<p>This introductory page is inserted, not with the purpose
of reviewing the contents of the book&mdash;a custom,
to our mind, more honored in the breach than the observance&mdash;but
merely to inform those who look within
the pages, the seekers after knowledge concerning the
laws of Oneirology and the bases of Fortune Telling,
that they will find much to instruct, interest and amuse.
While avoiding undue prolixity, the subjects are comprehensively
and exhaustively treated, proving it to be
more valuable as a book of reference than any other of
similar character ever before given to the public.</p>

<h2>DREAMS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION.</h2>

<p>Although much prejudice exists as to the origination of Dreams
and the various interpretations given them, the fact is incontrovertible
that they have, in all ages and among all nations, borne a
conspicuous part in shaping destinies. Both sacred and profane
history is replete with dreams which have had more or less influence
upon the lives of the dreamers. Innumerable are the instances
in which have been prefigured in dreams occurrences that have
actually taken place, and many dangers have been averted by
heeding warnings given during sleep. Of course it would be unwise
to place full credence in the prognostications of all dreams,
and equally so to totally disregard them. To both the educated
and the illiterate, dreams, of whatever nature, point a moral; and
those who heedlessly ignore their lessons often experience cause
for regret. Appended will be found a succinct compendium of
the scientific and philosophic researches of many gifted in the art
of divination.</p>

<p><b>Acquaintance.</b>&mdash;To dream that you fight with them signifies
distraction, especially if the person so dreaming be sick. <b>Adversary.</b>&mdash;To
dream that you receive obstruction from him, shows
that you will dispatch your business speedily. <b>Adultery.</b>&mdash;For
a person to dream that they have committed it, shows they will
meet great contentions and disputes. <b>Almonds.</b>&mdash;To dream one
sees or eats almonds, signifies difficulties and trouble. <b>Alms.</b>&mdash;To
dream that they are begged of you, and you deny to give them,
shows want and misery to the dreamer; but to dream you give
them freely is a sign of joy and gladness. <b>Anchor.</b>&mdash;To dream
you see one, signifies great assurance and certain joys. <b>Altar.</b>&mdash;To
dream you uncover or discover an altar, betokens joy and gladness.
<b>Angel.</b>&mdash;To dream you see angels is good, but to speak
with or call upon them is evil. <b>Anger.</b>&mdash;To dream that you have
been provoked to anger shows that you have powerful enemies.
<b>Angling.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are angling, betokens much affliction
and trouble in something which you desire to get. <b>Apes.</b>&mdash;To
dream you have seen or had anything to do with them, signifies
malicious, weak, strange and secret enemies; also a malefactor
and deceiver. <b>Apparition.</b>&mdash;To dream you see an apparition, or
spirit, clothed in white, signifies deceit and temptation to sin.
<b>Adam.</b>&mdash;To dream you see this father of men, this inhabitant of
Paradise, who was betrayed by Eve into sin, is a happy omen. If
he looks pleasant, be sure you will succeed in whatever you undertake.
If he looks displeased and angry, then you must use great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
caution in all your dealings, for some mischief is intended you,
but you will get the better of it. Be careful, if he speaks to you,
to mind what he says, and observe it as faithfully as you possibly
can. <b>Absence.</b>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To dream of any absent friends,</div>
<div class="verse">Good news of them, or ill, portends;</div>
<div class="verse">But if at thy bedside they seem,</div>
<div class="verse">Their deaths, perhaps, may solve thy dream.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><b>Abuse.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are abused and insulted, is a certain
sign some dispute will happen between you and some person with
whom you have business; therefore after such a dream you should
be particularly careful of yourself and be as gentle and mild as
possible, that you may not give those with whom you have dealings
any advantage over you. <b>Acorns.</b>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To dream of acorns do not slight,</div>
<div class="verse">It promises both strength and might.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><b>Ague.</b>&mdash;To dream you have an ague, denotes that you are in
danger of becoming a drunkard and a glutton. To dream your
sweetheart has an ague, is a lucky omen; it shows you are beloved,
and that you will be happy with the object of your wishes, but
never very rich. <b>Apparel.</b>&mdash;Nothing more demonstrates the
events that are about to happen to you, than dreaming of wearing
apparel; but almost every color has a different interpretation, and
must depend on its being new or old, its fitting you, or being too
big or too little. To dream you are dressed in white, is a sure
token of success in the first object you undertake, and that you
will be successful in love, and that your sweetheart is of good temper
and amiable disposition. To dream that you are dressed in
green denotes that you are about to take a journey to your advantage,
and that your sweetheart prefers you to all other lovers. To
dream that you are dressed in black is an unlucky omen. To
dream that you are dressed in blue, denotes happiness. If you
dream you are dressed in scarlet, you are thereby warned of some
very heavy calamity. To dream you are dressed in yellow, is
rather lucky than otherwise. To dream you are dressed in crimson,
indicates that you will live to a good old age, and be neither very
fortunate or unfortunate through life; it denotes a dispute between
landlord and tenant, which will be settled amicably to the
advantage of the latter. To dream that you are dressed in a variety
of colors, denotes a variety of fortunes is about to attend you.
To dream you are fashionably dressed and in good company, is
very good for the dreamer; he will rise considerably above his
present condition. To dream your clothes fit you well and are
comfortable to the season of the year, is favorable and denotes
success. To dream your clothes do not fit you, and that they are
not suitable to the season, denotes death of some friend and a loss
by fire. To dream you see another dressed in any of the modes
above described, forebodes to the person dreamt of the same fortunes.
To dream you are dressed in new clothes, is a very favorable
omen; it portends honors and success to your undertakings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<b>Apparitions.</b>&mdash;To dream you see a ghost, goblin, spectre and
such kind of things, is of a very unfortunate nature; if you are
in love, it is a certain sign of your not being beloved in return;
depend upon it some one is about to deceive you and that you are
friendly with one who is your most inveterate enemy. <b>Arms.</b>&mdash;To
dream your arms are withered is a certain sign that you will decay
in health and fortune. To dream they are growing strong signifies
that some unexpected success will attend you. To dream
that your right arm is cut off, denotes you will lose some male relation.
To dream your left arm is cut off, denotes you will lose
some near female relative. For a married woman to dream her
arms have grown lusty and strong, denotes that she will have
many male children, that her husband will arrive at public honors
and will grow rich and make many friends. <b>Apples.</b>&mdash;To dream
of apples betokens long life and success, a boy to a woman with
child, faithfulness in your sweetheart and riches by trade. <b>Apricots.</b>&mdash;To
dream of apricots, denotes health and prosperity, a
speedy marriage, dutiful children and success in love. <b>Asses.</b>&mdash;To
dream you see jackasses, is a good sign. To dream you are
riding on an ass, is the forerunner of some foolish quarrel. To
dream that you are driving an ass, denotes that you will fall into
some trouble, of which you will get the better. To dream an ass
runs after you, denotes that some slander will be raised against
you by some foolish persons, who will be themselves the victims
of the scandal raised against you. To dream you see an ass fall
loaded, is a very good import and shows that you will be the founder
of your own fortune. <b>Attorneys.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are
speaking with them, shows hindrance of business and that a man
will have little success in his affairs. <b>Armed Men.</b>&mdash;To see
them in your dream, is a good sign, and denotes one void of fear;
to dream you see an armed man fly is a sign of victory; to see
men come in arms against you, signifies sadness. <b>Action.</b>&mdash;To
dream that you are sent of an errand, signifies great loss to the
married; to the lover it denotes success in his pursuit, and that he
will shortly marry a very amiable and accomplished maiden. For
a maiden to dream that she was sent on an errand, denotes that she
will shortly marry the object of her affections and be very happy.
To the sick it denotes a speedy recovery. <b>Ascend.</b>&mdash;For one to
dream they ascend towards the skies is favorable, particularly so if
the clouds appear bright. <b>Air.</b>&mdash;To dream of the atmosphere has
a variety of interpretations, and depends entirely on its appearance.
If you dream the sky is clear, of a fine blue, calm and
serene, then it is a good omen. To dream that it is streaked with
white, denotes that many severe difficulties will befall you, over
which you will eventually triumph. To dream that it was full of
thick, dark and heavy clouds, is an unfavorable token; disappointments
will attend you. To dream that the sky is streaked with
red and looks fiery, denotes that in love you will be successful; in
business not so; it also forewarns you that sickness and trouble
will attend your family. <b>Altar.</b>&mdash;To dream you are at the altar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and receiving the holy sacrament is a very unfavorable omen, and
denotes many heavy and severe afflictions. <b>Adder.</b>&mdash;A person
that dreams of the asp and the adder, is thereby betokened to have
stores of money and rich wives. <b>Assassin.</b>&mdash;To dream of an assassin
is a warning not to be neglected. Shun all pretending
friends, lend no money, be ever on your guard, and you may
escape destruction, which is planned for your ruin. <b>Ants.</b>&mdash;To
dream of these industrious little insects, hath a variety of interpretations,
depending on the manner in which you dream of them;
if you see them running about, it denotes that you will be a great
loser by some plan that you will undertake for gain. If you dream
you see them busily employed laying in their winter stores, it is a
good omen&mdash;things will prosper with you. If they appear to be
devoured by other animals, and otherwise injured and trodden
upon, then it is a bad omen. If you dream of these insects when
you are sick, you must expect to recover very slowly. <b>Auction.</b>&mdash;To
dream you attend an auction is, on the whole, unfavorable.
If you purchase, expect loss of property. If you only attend, you
are sure to meet with a heavy deprivation of friends and property.
If you pass by one, then you will attain, in a few years, all that
you moderately desire.</p>

<p><b>Bear.</b>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To dream a bear thy step pursues,</div>
<div class="verse">A cruel foe some mischief brews.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><b>Beggars.</b>&mdash;To dream of beggars is rather unfavorable, especially
to lovers and persons in business. To dream they beg alms of you
and that you refuse it, denotes misery, want, and a prison; if you are
in love, some scandalous person will ruin you with your sweetheart.
To dream that you give them alms, indicates success in business,
and that you will obtain, after much difficulty, the object of your
affections; your children will be sickly, and narrowly escape
many dangers. <b>Bleeding.</b>&mdash;To dream you are bleeding, denotes
loss of goods and character, and that your sweetheart will not
marry you. To dream you see another bleeding, indicates that
some person who pretends to be your friend is about to take some
great advantage of you. To dream you draw blood of another,
denotes that you will recover a lawsuit and be successful in love
and business. To dream another draws blood of you, is a certain
prognostic that you will be unsuccessful in love and in business,
and in everything you undertake. <b>Blind.</b>&mdash;To dream of being
blind is a sure sign that you repose your confidence in some person
who is your bitter enemy; it denotes also that your sweetheart
is unfaithful and prefers another; in business it denotes that you
will lose money, and that your servants lack fidelity. <b>Boat.</b>&mdash;To
dream that you are on the water in a boat, provided you are in
company, denotes prosperity and success in your undertakings.
If you dream you are in a boat alone, it is a bad omen. To dream
the boat oversets, is the most fatal of all omens. <b>Bridge.</b>&mdash;To
dream you are crossing over a bridge is a good omen&mdash;it denotes
prosperity through life, and success in love. To dream you are
passing under a bridge, indicates that you will never be perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
at ease. If you meet with any obstruction on the bridge it foretells
a fit of sickness; are you a lover, it denotes that your sweetheart
will be afflicted with illness. To dream a bridge breaks
down with you denotes sudden death. <b>Bread.</b>&mdash;To dream you
see a great quantity of loaves of bread, denotes success in life.
To dream you are eating good bread, denotes that you will be
shortly married. To dream the bread is musty and bad, denotes
the loss of friends and that some near relation will shortly die.
<b>Brother.</b>&mdash;To dream you see your brother, denotes a speedy marriage
in your family and that the dreamer will not be long-lived; if
you are in love it is a favorable omen. <b>Building.</b>&mdash;To dream of
being amongst buildings, denotes that you will change your present
place of residence and that you will make many new friends
in life; if you are in love it foretells your sweetheart is about to
remove at a distance from you, and that you will be in danger of
losing the affections of your lover by a new face. <b>Bulls.</b>&mdash;To
dream you are pursued by a bull, denotes that many injurious reports
will be spread on your character. If you dream the bull
gores you, or tosses you, then expect shortly to lose your liberty;
it denotes that some person in power will do you an injury.
<b>Burning.</b>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To dream of burning doth imply,</div>
<div class="verse">A sudden danger, ripe and nigh;</div>
<div class="verse">Of all escapes you then beware,</div>
<div class="verse">For though fate threatens, it may spare.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><b>Butchers.</b>&mdash;To dream of seeing butchers is in general a very unlucky
omen; it always foretells some injury to the dreamer. If
you see them cutting up meat some of your friends will be
hanged, and you will experience much misery and poverty.
<b>Bed.</b>&mdash;To dream you go to the bedside of your lover, foretells a
speedy marriage; if you dream you go between the sheets, you
will have a child within twelve months after marriage, who will
become rich and afford you support in your old age. <b>Banquets.</b>&mdash;To
dream of banquets denotes poverty and want. <b>Bat.</b>&mdash;To
dream of bats is very inauspicious. <b>Belly.</b>&mdash;To dream one’s belly
is bigger and fuller than ordinary, shows his family and estate will
increase. If one dreams his belly is grown lean and shrunk up,
he will be joyfully delivered of some bad accident. If any one
dreams that his belly is swelled, and yet notwithstanding be empty,
he will become poor, though he be rich in the esteem of many
people in the world. If any one dreams his belly aches, he will
be afflicted in his family and have many cares upon him. <b>Blowing
the Fire.</b>&mdash;To dream you are blowing the fire indicates to the
lover, that your sweetheart is very angry with you. <b>Barn.</b>&mdash;To
dream of a barn, and that you see it well stored with corn,
denotes much good; it foretells to a man that he will marry some
rich woman; to a maid, that she will marry a man who will grow
very rich by his industry, and be promoted in the state. If you
dream you see an empty barn, the reverse will happen. <b>Bathing.</b>&mdash;To
dream of a bath is a very unpropitious omen; expect after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
it to experience many mishaps and much sorrow. If you are in
love, your sweetheart will experience many crosses and losses; but
to dream you are bathing yourself in clear water, denotes happiness,
prosperity and success in love&mdash;if the water is dirty, then it
foretells shame and sorrow, and a disappointment in love. <b>Beheading.</b>&mdash;To
dream you see any one beheaded, is a good omen;
if you are in love, you will marry the object of your affections.
If you are in prison, you will speedily gain your liberty. <b>Bells.</b>&mdash;To
dream you hear the bells ringing, denotes a speedy marriage
and that you will receive some very good news. <b>Bees.</b>&mdash;To
dream they sting you, denotes loss of character, and if you are in
love, of your sweetheart. To dream you see them at work, is a very
lucky dream; it forebodes great success by your own industry.
To dream you see them making their honey under your own roof
is the best omen in the world. For the rich to dream of bees, is
rather unlucky, but to the poor, they denote comfort, affluence
and success. <b>Beard.</b>&mdash;For a man to dream he has a long beard,
denotes good fortune; if he is in trade, he will thrive; if he is in
love, he will marry the present object of his affections, who will
bring him some money; if he is a farmer, it denotes good crops,
and an addition to his farm. If a married woman dreams of a
beard, it is unlucky; it foretells the loss of her husband and that
she will fall into great distress. If a maid dreams of a beard, it
denotes that she will be quickly married and that the fruit of her
womb is a boy. For a woman to dream that she has a beard is a
very lucky omen, and denotes that she will speedily attain her most
sanguine desires. <b>Battle.</b>&mdash;To dream of battle in the streets,
forewarns you against secret enemies who will endeavor to harm
you. If you are in love, your sweetheart is false to you. <b>Bacon.</b>&mdash;To
dream of bacon denotes the death of some friend or relation
and that enemies will endeavor to do you mischief. In love, it denotes
disappointment and discontent. <b>Back.</b>&mdash;To dream you see
your back, betokens some uneasiness; for the back to be broken
or hurt, shows you will be scoffed at by your enemies; yet to
dream of the backbone, signifies health and success in love, marriage
and business. <b>Basin.</b>&mdash;To dream of a basin, signifies a good
maid; and to dream you eat or drink therein, shows you have a
love to the servant maid. For a man to see himself in a basin as
in a glass, denotes he shall have children by a servant maid.
<b>Beech and Myrtle Trees.</b>&mdash;Signifies wanton women and are
good for those who would undertake any such business; to others
they are pain and labor. <b>Beans.</b>&mdash;To dream you are eating beans
always signifies trouble and dissension. <b>Beets.</b>&mdash;To dream of
eating beets, signifies freedom from trouble and expedition on
business, because they make the body soluble. <b>Burial.</b>&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Briars and Brambles.</b>&mdash;If you dream you are passing through
places covered with these things, it portends troubles; if they
prick you, secret enemies will do you an injury with your friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and unfavorable tales will make your sweetheart shy of you; if
they draw blood of you, expect heavy losses in trade. If you
dream you pass through them without injury, then you will at
last triumph over all your enemies and become happy. <b>Bells.</b>&mdash;To
dream one hears ringing of bells, if of a sanguine complexion,
brings them good news; but to others, it shows alarms, murmurings,
disturbances and commotions. <b>Birding.</b>&mdash;To dream you catch
birds, signifies profit and pleasure. <b>Bird’s Nest.</b>&mdash;To dream you
find one is a good sign. To dream you find one without eggs or birds,
shows you will meet with great disappointments. <b>Birth.</b>&mdash;To dream
of one’s birth is good for him that is poor; but to him that is rich,
this dream signifies that others shall rule over him against his will.
<b>Blindman’s Buff.</b>&mdash;To dream that one plays blindman’s buff, signifies
prosperity, joy and pleasure. <b>Blossoming of Trees.</b>&mdash;To dream
you see all sorts of trees blossoming, is a sign of joy, comfort and
recreation. <b>Brewing and Baking.</b>&mdash;To dream of brewing and
baking is the sign of an ill housewife, who lies dreaming in bed,
when she should be at work and doing her business. <b>Breast.</b>&mdash;To
dream that you have hairy breasts and the tap pup covered
with hair, denotes great gain and profit to men; but to a woman,
loss of her husband. If a young married woman dreams that her
breasts are full and spurting out milk, it signifies that she is with
child and that it will be a perfect birth. If a virgin dreams thus,
she is near her marriage. If a woman dreams she has sore breasts
she is threatened with death. <b>Broth.</b>&mdash;To dream of eating broth
is a good sign and signifies profit and gain. <b>Buried Alive.</b>&mdash;For
a man to dream he is buried alive, signifies he shall have much
wealth. <b>Burned.</b>&mdash;For a man to dream he is burned, signifies
(according to the interpretations of the Persians and Egyptians)
that he shall be rich, honored and respected; but if he imagines
that he was burned by a fire that did not quite consume him, he
will inevitably perish in the end. <b>Basket.</b>&mdash;For a man to dream
of baskets is evil; it denotes decay of business to a merchant,
want of employment to a mechanic, and loss of place to a servant;
but if a woman dreams she receives a number of baskets it
is a good omen, and especially so if well filled; to a maiden it denotes
that she will have many new lovers; to a wife, that she will
have an increase in her family, and to the widow, that she will
soon marry again. <b>Bonnet.</b>&mdash;For a maiden to dream she gets a
new bonnet, gives promise of a new lover, but Mother Shipton
says that much depends on the color; if green, he will be deceitful;
if blue, he will prove affectionate; if pink, his love will not be
lasting; if yellow or white, he will quickly improve marriage; but
if a female loses her bonnet, it behooves her to be guarded of her
virtue, for she is in danger of being led astray; if it be blown off,
she will have something she dearly prizes stolen from her. <b>Buttons.</b>&mdash;To
dream of bright buttons is seldom good; if rusty, it
portends misfortune; if covered, sadness. If a man dreams he
has lost all the buttons of his clothes, it is a sign he will not live
long.</p>

<p><b>Cards.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are playing at cards is a sure prognostic
that you will be in love, and speedily married. If you hold
a great many picture cards, your marriage will be the means of
making you rich and happy. If your cards are mostly diamonds,
the person you marry will be of a sour and disagreeable temper.
If they are mostly hearts, your marriage will cement love, and you
will be very happy and have many children. If they are mostly
clubs, you will get money by your marriage. If they are mostly
spades, your marriage will turn out very unhappy and your children
will be unfaithful and subject to many hardships. If you
are in expectation of a place, you will get it, and if you are in
business you will be successful. <b>Cats.</b>&mdash;To dream of these domestic
animals is indicative of much trouble and vexation; it
denotes to the lover that your sweetheart is treacherous. If you
keep servants, they are unfaithful, and will rob you. To dream
you kill a cat, denotes that you discover a thief and prosecute him
to conviction; expect also to lose your own liberty through some
pretended friend. <b>Cattle.</b>&mdash;To dream you see cattle feeding, denotes
great prosperity and unexpected success; to a lover it foretells
a happy marriage, with many children, and to a man it shows
that his wife will receive some unexpected legacy. To dream you
are driving cattle denotes that you will become rich by industry.
If you are in love it shows that you have many rivals, but that
you will distance them all. To dream you see fat cattle also denotes
a plentiful year. To dream you see lean and hungry cattle,
denotes scarcity and famine. <b>Clock.</b>&mdash;To dream you hear the
clock strike, denotes that you will be speedily married, and that
you will be moderately successful in life. To dream you are
counting the hours, if in the forenoon, shows much happiness, and
that your sweetheart is true to you, but if in the afternoon, that
misfortune and danger will attend you, and that your sweetheart
is false and loves another. <b>Coach.</b>&mdash;To dream you are riding in
a coach is a very unlucky omen. It foretells poverty and disgrace.
If you are in love, your sweetheart will be idle and bad-tempered.
If you are in trade, you will become bankrupt, and if you are a
farmer, your goods will be seized for rent. It also denotes that
the dreamer will shortly be in prison. <b>Coals.</b>&mdash;To dream of coals
is a very unlucky omen. It denotes much affliction and trouble.
To dream you see coals burning, if they are very clear and bright,
is a good sign. To dream you see the coals extinguished and reduced
to cinders, denotes death, either to yourself or some near
relation or friend; it also indicates great losses, and forewarns you
of beggary and prison. <b>Comets.</b>&mdash;To dream you see one of these
extraordinary ethereal substances, is ominous of war, plague,
famine, and death; to the lover it forebodes an entire frustration
of his hopes; to the farmer, failure of crops; and to the seaman,
storms and shipwrecks. After such a dream change, if possible,
your present place of residence. <b>Cook.</b>&mdash;</p>

unthrashed corn, is a very favorable omen; it denotes success in
business; to the lover it announces that you will marry, have
many children, and become rich and happy. If you are a sailor,
it denotes a lucrative voyage and fine weather, and that you will
be near marrying in the next port you touch at. If you dream
you are gathering ripe corn, it is the most fortunate dream you can
have. <b>Crowns.</b>&mdash;To dream you see these emblems of royalty,
portends success and elevation to dignities, either in the church or
state. For a maid to dream of a crown, shows she will marry a
very industrious man, or one who is rich. <b>Crutches.</b>&mdash;To dream
you are walking on crutches, is a very unfavorable omen. To
dream you see another walking on crutches, denotes that these
things will happen to some friend. If you are a married man,
then that your wife is inconstant; if a married woman, then that
the husband is ruining himself with some harlot. <b>Currants.</b>&mdash;To
dream of currants prefigures happiness in life, success in undertakings,
constancy in your sweetheart, handsome children to the
married, riches to the farmer and tradesman. <b>Church.</b>&mdash;To
dream of church is portentous of evil. If you are in a church
during divine service, you will be engaged in a lawsuit, or some
other quarrel that will very near ruin you. If you are in love,
your sweetheart is unfaithful, and prefers another. If you expect
a place, it forebodes disappointment. If you are in trade, you will
never thrive in your present situation. <b>Cage.</b>&mdash;To dream of letting
birds out of a cage denotes a speedy marriage. To a person
in business it denotes success, and to a farmer it denotes good crops.
<b>Cain.</b>&mdash;To dream of the firstborn son of man, who was Adam’s

ill luck; your sweetheart will betray you and marry another. If
you are a farmer, you will have a bad crop and lose many of your
poultry. If you are in trade some sharper will defraud you. If
you go to sea, you will lose your goods and narrowly escape shipwreck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<b>Chess.</b>&mdash;If any one dreams that he plays at chess with an
acquaintance, it is a sign that he will fall out with somebody he

his enemies. And on the contrary, if he dream that he
loses, he will be overcome and worsted in the combat. <b>Clouds.</b>&mdash;To

anger. <b>Caterpillars.</b>&mdash;To dream you see caterpillars, signifies

servitude and pain to everybody; but to dream that you

sweetheart. If you are in trade, it denotes loss of goods, if
not of liberty. <b>Dogs.</b>&mdash;To dream of these faithful and domestic
animals has very different significations, according to the manner
in which you see them. If they fawn and fondle upon you, then
it is a very lucky omen. If you are in love, your sweetheart will
marry you and be very happy. If they are barking and snarling
at you, then depend that enemies are secretly endeavoring to destroy

the dreamer. To the lover it denotes that your sweetheart is good-tempered

see another person dead, denotes unkind usage from your friends.
<b>Drunkenness.</b>&mdash;To dream you are drunk, is one of those dreams
by which the dreamer is forewarned of that of which at present he
knows nothing. It denotes that some person whom yet you do

good; to drink oil, signifies poison. To dream you are drinking

drink, it is a sign he will be beloved by some lady and grow
rich thereby. <b>Dunghill.</b>&mdash;To dream you stand on a dunghill is a
favorable omen. It is a sure forerunner of success in everything
undertaken at this time. For a maiden to dream she is on a dunghill,

sought after for relief by some that are in great want and
extremity. <b>Earthworms.</b>&mdash;To dream of earthworms, signifies
secret enemies that endeavor to ruin and destroy us. <b>Ear.</b>&mdash;If
a man dreams his ears be fair and well shaped, it shows he shall
come to great renown; but if he dreams his ears are ill-favored and
deformed, it shows the contrary. This dream is ill to a servant,
and those who have a lawsuit, if he be a plaintiff or the defendant,
but it is good to an artificer or one that worketh with his
hands, for he shall have many that will employ him. To dream
that one picks or cleans his ears, betokens that good news shall
come forth one side or other. But to dream that the ears have
been beaten or chafed, signifies we shall hear ill news. If any one
dreams his ear is hurt or split, he will be offended by some one that
belongs to him, or by some friend. If he dream that his ear is

dream you see the mother of all men, is a favorable omen. It
denotes great happiness to the lover. <b>Eyebrows.</b>&mdash;To dream the
eyebrows are hairy and of a good grace, is good, especially to a

succeed in the matrimonial way. <b>Evil Spirits.</b>&mdash;To dream evil

and happiness will be in store for you. <b>Elf.</b>&mdash;To dream of an elf
signifies a happy return of one long absent; presents of value may

his affections. <b>Tarts.</b>&mdash;To dream one makes tarts, signifies joy
and delight. <b>Treasure.</b>&mdash;To dream you find a treasure in the
earth, is very ominous. It shows that you will be betrayed by
some one whom you make your bosom friend; that your sweetheart
is unfaithful and grossly deceives you; and should you not be
able to carry it away, then it denotes that you will have some very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
heavy loss, and that you will be waylaid by robbers, who will ill-treat
you. <b>Turnips.</b>&mdash;To dream of being in a turnip field, or that
you see this wholesome vegetable, denotes acquisition of riches, and
high employments in the state. To the lover, they augur great
fidelity and an exceedingly good temper in your sweetheart, and
that if you marry you will be very happy, have fine children and
thrive in the world. <b>Turkey.</b>&mdash;To dream you see a turkey strutting
about, is a sign you will overcome your enemies. To dream
you see or are amongst a drove of turkeys, betokens success in
your undertakings about this time. To dream of dead turkeys denotes
that you will encounter trouble that you will soon surmount.
<b>Tumbler.</b>&mdash;To dream you break a tumbler, is prognostic of secrets
being discovered that have long remained a mystery. To drink
from a clear tumbler, denotes health and activity; to drink from
a dirty one, the reverse. <b>Tops.</b>&mdash;To dream you are spinning tops
is ill. <b>Teapots.</b>&mdash;If a person dream of teapots they will soon
form new friendships.</p>

<p><b>Urn.</b>&mdash;To dream of this vessel has a happy signification, for it
foretells the marriage either of yourself, a near relative or a dear
companion. <b>Ugly.</b>&mdash;For a person to dream of being ugly or deformed,
indicates that the dreamer will be surprised by hearing
from a long absent friend a communication of a pleasing and gratifying
nature. <b>Undertaker.</b>&mdash;For a single person to dream of seeing
an undertaker enter the house, and attend to the mournful
obsequies of a funeral, denotes that the dreamer will be married in
a short time. For a married person to dream of seeing an undertaker
attending to his duties, is an indication that his family will
be increased in a short time.</p>

<p><b>Vermin.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are surrounded and attacked by
vermin, some creeping over your body, and others assailing you in
various parts of your frame, signifies that you will be gladdened
and rejoiced to learn that you have become entitled to the possession
of considerable property through the death of a relative.
<b>Villainy.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are exposed to some villainy by
one from whom you expected different conduct, denotes that you
will be astonished to learn that you have had a fortune left to you
by one who was no relation. <b>Virgin.</b>&mdash;A virgin dreaming
that she has lost her virginity, signifies great danger. <b>Vow.</b>&mdash;To
dream that you have made a vow and broken it, is bad to all.
<b>Velvet.</b>&mdash;To dream you trade with a stranger in velvet and other
silks, is a sign of profit and joy. <b>Vote.</b>&mdash;To dream you are voting
is bad, particularly to sick persons. For a newly-married woman
to dream of voting, is a sure sign her first child will be a boy, who
will come to great honors. <b>Vulture.</b>&mdash;To dream of the vulture is
unfortunate to all except sick persons, to whom it foretells a speedy
recovery. <b>Victuals.</b>&mdash;To dream of victuals and that you eat a
variety of them, signifies loss. <b>Vines.</b>&mdash;To dream of vines denotes
health and wealth to the dreamer. To dream you are a vine,
foretells abundance and fertility; for which we have the example
of Astyages, King of the Medes, who dreamed that his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
brought forth a vine, which was a prognostic of the grandeur,
riches and felicity of Cyrus, who was born of her body after this
dream. <b>Vinegar.</b>&mdash;To dream you drink vinegar, signifies sickness.
<b>Violin.</b>&mdash;To dream one plays or sees another play upon the
violin or other musical instrument, signifies good news and concord
between man and wife, master and apprentice, brother and
sister, &amp;c. <b>Vomit.</b>&mdash;To dream of vomiting, whether of blood,
meat or phlegm, signifies to the poor, profit, to the rich, hurt.
<b>Venison.</b>&mdash;To dream about venison, denotes change in affairs.
To dream you eat of it, signifies misfortune. <b>Volcano.</b>&mdash;To dream
about volcanos forbodes liberty to a person in prison, and peace
and happiness to those out of it.</p>

<p><b>Walking.</b>&mdash;To dream one is walking in the dirt, or among
thorns, signifies sickness. To dream one is walking in the water,
or some torrent, signifies adversity and grief. <b>War.</b>&mdash;To dream
of war and affairs of war, signifies trouble and danger. <b>Washing.</b>&mdash;For
a man to dream he washes or bathes himself in baths or
hot-houses, signifies riches, prosperity and health to the sick. But
to dream he washes or bathes himself contrary to the common
custom, or in his clothes, is evil and betokeneth sickness and great
danger. To dream that you were in fountains, ponds or current
water, and in fair and clear floods, is good, but not that you swim,
for that is a sign of danger and sickness. Washing is a sure sign
of removal. <b>Wedding.</b>&mdash;For a man that is sick to dream that he
is wedded to a maid, shows he shall die quickly. If any one
dream he is wedded to a deformed woman, it signifies discontent.
If to a handsome woman, joy. <b>Wife.</b>&mdash;If a man dreams he sees
his wife married to another, it denotes change of affairs or condition.
If a woman dreams she is married to another man, it is the
same. <b>Want.</b>&mdash;For a person to dream that he or she comes to
sudden want in temporal things, denotes that an unexpected good
fortune awaits them by the death of a wealthy relative or the success
of some speculation or business bargain. <b>Water.</b>&mdash;To dream you are
drinking water, denotes great trouble and adversity. In trade loss of
business and being arrested; to the lover, it shows your sweetheart is
false, prefers another, and will never marry you. <b>Watermill.</b>&mdash;To
dream of being in a water-mill is a favorable omen. To the tradesman
it denotes great increase of business; to the farmer, abundant crops;
in love, success, a rich sweetheart and a happy marriage. <b>Wasps.</b>&mdash;To
dream that you are stung by wasps, signifies vexation and
trouble by envious persons. <b>Weasel.</b>&mdash;To dream of weasels,
shows a man in love with some ill-natured woman, by whom he
will be ensnared, or some domestic who will cajole his master by
subtlety. <b>Whales.</b>&mdash;If you dream you are sitting on a whale’s
back, it is good. As the whale is the greatest of the water animals,
so the one so dreaming will become a great person and live in
peace many years. <b>Wild Boar.</b>&mdash;The wild boar, in dreams, signifies
a furious enemy, well furnished with all things necessary.
And thus, if any one dreams he has hunted or taken a wild boar,
he will chase or take some enemy that hath the same qualities as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the wild boar. <b>Wrist.</b>&mdash;To dream that your wrists are broken, is
very good. It foretells that you will marry your present lover and
be very happy. <b>Walls.</b>&mdash;To dream you are walking on a crazy,
old and narrow wall, denotes that you will engage in some very
dangerous enterprise that will cause you much trouble and vexation.
If you get down without hurting yourself, or the wall’s falling,
then you will succeed. If the wall should fall whilst you are
upon it, you will be disappointed. If you are walking between
walls and the passage is very narrow and difficult, you will be engaged
in some quarrel, or disagreeable affair, from which it will
require great circumspection and caution on your part to disengage
yourself. But if you get from between them safe, you will
settle well in life, marry an agreeable partner, have children and
become rich and happy. <b>Weeping.</b>&mdash;To dream one weeps or
grieves, whether it be for a friend departed or any other cause, is
joy and mirth. <b>Wheat.</b>&mdash;To dream you see or are walking in a
field of wheat, is a very favorable omen, and denotes great prosperity
and riches. In love, it argues a completion of your most
sanguine wishes and foretells much happiness, with fine children,
when you marry. If you have a lawsuit, you will gain it and you
will be successful in all your undertakings. <b>Wood.</b>&mdash;To dream
you are cutting or chopping wood, clearly shows that you will be
happy in your family, and become rich and respectable in life.
To dream you are carrying wood upon your back, shows that you
will rise to affluence by your industry, but that your partner will
be of a bad temper and your children undutiful. If you dream
you are walking or sitting alone in an extensive wood by a running
stream, it denotes that you will quickly fall in love, and also
that you will be often married. To dream that you are walking
or sitting there with a worthy object of your affections, betokens
your speedy union, which will prove so felicitous that you will be
called “the happy couple.” <b>Wool.</b>&mdash;To dream you are buying
or selling wool, denotes prosperity and great affluence, by means
or industry and trade. To the lover, it is a favorable omen. Your
sweetheart is thereby shown to be of an amiable disposition, very
constant and deeply in love with you. <b>Will.</b>&mdash;Dreaming of
making your will signifies that you will live a long time in uninterrupted
happiness and joy. For a woman with child to dream
that she has made her will, is unfortunate, as it denotes an unfortunate
trial of labor. <b>Wren.</b>&mdash;To dream of this little bird is good,
as the wren is noted for its innocence; the person so dreaming is
certain of having a noble friend. But to dream you kill it, is bad.
<b>Walnuts.</b>&mdash;To dream of walnuts, portends difficulties and misfortunes
in life. If you have children, your eldest son will marry
a woman who will make him very unhappy. In love, it foretells
infidelity and disappointment. To the seaman, storms and shipwreck.
To the tradesman, loss of goods and reputation through a
confidential servant. <b>Well.</b>&mdash;If a young man dreams that he
draws water out of a well, it signifies a speedy marriage to a fair
maid, who will bring him a portion. If the water be troubled, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
will be disturbed by her, and suddenly fall sick. If he seems to
give to others clear well water to drink, it denotes that he will enrich
them. But if the water be troubled, he will afflict them. If
he dreams that he sees a person fall into a well, it signifies that the
person dreamed of shall die quickly. <b>Wounds.</b>&mdash;To dream you
are wounded, is a very favorable omen, especially if it be with a
sword. To the lover, it denotes success in your amours, and with
an agreeable partner, who will be faithful and affectionate. To
the tradesman, profit; and to the farmer, increase in his cattle and
plentiful crops. To the sailor, a profitable voyage, with success in
love. <b>Wager.</b>&mdash;To dream you have laid a wager on some matter
in dispute, or on some event that has to come off, denotes that you
are in danger of being subjected to a serious accident, and that
through the interposition and courage of a friend you are permitted
to escape with only a slight injury. <b>Wages.</b>&mdash;For a
workingman to dream that he has had his wages reduced, signifies
that he is about to be removed to a more lucrative situation. To
dream that he has had his wages advanced, denotes that he will
shortly be without employment. <b>Waves.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are
on the sea-shore, and surrounded by the waves, is an indication that
you will be shortly placed in very difficult and distressing circumstances,
out of which it will require all your energy and perseverance
to escape. <b>Waltzing.</b>&mdash;To dream you are waltzing with
some agreeable partner, is an indication that you will be subjected
to some unpleasant treatment from one from whom you expected
nothing but kindness. <b>Widow.</b>&mdash;For a newly married woman to
dream that she is a widow, signifies that she will be blessed with
comfort and happiness in domestic life and be the mother of dutiful
and obedient children. <b>Wig.</b>&mdash;For one who has no lack of
hair to dream that he wears a wig, signifies that he will be compelled
to stand before a judge in a court of law, either as a criminal
or as a witness. <b>Witchcraft.</b>&mdash;For a person to dream that
he has been to visit a supposed fortune-teller, denotes that misfortune
shall befall him, unpleasantness in his family, treachery in his
place of business and deception in those he supposed his best
friends. <b>Worms.</b>&mdash;To dream that you see a great number of
worms in your path, is an indication that the death of either yourself
or of some one dear to you may shortly be expected. For a
young woman to dream that she has trod upon a worm that was
crawling in her path, signifies that the engagement between her
and her lover will be in danger of being broken off through the
machinations of a jealous rival, but eventually a reconciliation will
be accomplished. <b>Wreath.</b>&mdash;For a young woman to dream that
her head is adorned with the bridal wreath, is an indication that
death will shortly visit either herself or some one dear to her.
<b>Wreck.</b>&mdash;To dream that you are witnessing the wreck of some
vessel at a short distance from the sea-shore, is an indication that
one in whom you reposed great confidence will deceive you.

<p><b>Yew Tree.</b>&mdash;To dream of a yew tree, is an indication of the funeral
of a very aged person, by whose death the dreamer will
derive some benefit or protecting hand among the relations of the
deceased person. <b>Yeast.</b>&mdash;If a young housewife dreams that she
is kneading bread with yeast, she may conclude that she will be
the mother of a large family of children.</p>

<p><b>Zodiac.</b>&mdash;To dream of the twelve signs of the zodiac, shows to
a man that he will be a great traveler, and sail once around the
world. To a woman, that she will wed a foreigner who is deeply
skilled in astronomy.</p>

<h2>PHYSIOGNOMY.</h2>

<p>The principles of philosophy demonstrate that the human features
are a reflex of the mental and physical workings of the system,
as it is from time to time operated upon by surrounding
circumstances, and they therefore act an important part in depicting
the lights and shades of temperament and disposition. So,
also, the color and nature of the hair are indicative of character.
In the pages immediately following will be found fully presented
prognostics to be drawn from the latter, as also from the forehead,
eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, and the whole assemblage of
features.</p>

<p>The gentleman whose hair is very black and smooth, hanging
far over his shoulders, and in large quantity, is mild, but resolute;
cool until greatly provoked; not much inclined to excesses; constant
in his attachments; not liable to many misfortunes.</p>

<p>A lady with the same kind of hair is moderate in her desires of
every kind; addicted to reflection; not violent in love, but steady
in her attachments.</p>

<p>If the hair is very black, short and curling, the gentleman will
be very much given to liquor; somewhat quarrelsome and of unsettled
temper; desirous of riches, but will often be disappointed
in his wishes therein.</p>

<p>A gentleman with dark brown, long and smooth hair, is generally
of a robust constitution; obstinate in his temper, eager in his
pursuits, a lover of the fair sex, fond of variety in his ordinary
pursuits, exceedingly curious, and of a flexible disposition. He
will live long, unless guilty of early intemperance.</p>

<p>A lady with the same kind of hair will be nearly the same as
the gentleman, but more steady in her conduct and attachments,
especially in love. She will be of a good constitution, have many
children, enjoy good health and a reasonable share of happiness.</p>

<p>If the hair is short and bushy it will make very little alteration
in the gentleman or lady, but that the gentleman will be more forward
to strike when provoked and the lady will be more of a scold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman with light brown, long, smooth hair, is of a peaceable,
even, and rather generous temper; will prevent mischief if
in his power, but when very much provoked will strike furiously;
but is afterwards sorry for his passion and soon appeased; strongly
attached to the company of ladies and will protect them from
insult. Upon the whole, he is in general of an amiable character,
affable and kind.</p>

<p>A lady with the same kind of hair is tender-hearted, but hasty
in temper; neither obstinate nor haughty; her inclination to love
never unreasonable; her constitution will be good, but she will be
seldom very fortunate.</p>

<p>A gentleman with fair hair will be of a weak constitution; his
mind given much to reflection, especially on religious matters.
He will be assiduous in his occupation, but not given to rambling;
very moderate in his amorous wishes; but he will not live to an
old age.</p>

<p>A lady with this colored hair is on the contrary of a good constitution;
never to be diverted from her purpose; passionate in
love affairs, never easy unless in company, and delights in hearing
herself praised, especially for beauty; delights in dancing and
strong exercises and commonly lives to a great age.</p>

<p>A gentleman with long red hair is cunning, artful and deceitful;
he is much addicted to traffic of some kind, restless in his
disposition, constantly roving and desirous of enjoying the pleasures
of love. He is covetous of getting money and spends it
foolishly; he is indefatigable and no obstacle will induce him to
forsake his enterprise until he has seen the issue of it. He is
inclined to timidity, but by reflection may correct it and pass for a
man of courage.</p>

<p>A lady with the same kind of hair, is glib of tongue, talkative
and vain; her temper is impatient and fiery and will not submit
to contradiction; she has a constant flow of spirits and is much
given to the pleasures of love. However delicate her person may
seem, her constitution is generally vigorous; but she seldom lives
to see old age, for obvious reasons. Her promises are seldom to
be depended upon, because the next object that engrosses her attention
makes her forgetful of everything that preceded it, and
she will always resent any disappointment she may meet with.</p>

<p>If the hair falls off at the fore part of the head, the person will
be easily led, though otherwise rational, and will often be duped
when he thinks he is acting right; he will likewise frequently
meet with disappointments in money matters, which will either
hurt his credit, or force him to shorten his expenses.</p>

<p>If the hair falls off behind, he will be obstinate, peevish, passionate
and fond of commanding others, though he has no right,
and will grow angry if his advice is not followed. However preposterous,
he will be fond of hearing and telling old stories and
tales of ghosts and fairies, but will be a good domestic man and
provide for his family to the utmost of his power.</p>

<p>If the hair forms an arch around the forehead, without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
much indented at the temples, both the lady and the gentleman
will be innocent, credulous, moderate in all their desires, and
though not ardent in their pursuits, will still be persevering. They
will be modest, good-natured, prosperous and happy.</p>

<p>If the hair is indented at the temples, the person will be affable,
steady, good-natured, prudent and attentive to business, of a good
constitution and long-lived.</p>

<p>If the hair descends low upon the forehead, the person will be
selfish and designing; of a surly disposition, unsociable and given
to drinking. He will be addicted to avarice and his mind will be
always intent upon the means of carrying on his schemes.</p>

<p>The forehead that is large, round and smooth, announces the
lady or gentleman to be frank, open, generous and free, good-natured
and a safe companion; of a good understanding and
scorns to be guilty of any mean action; faithful to his promises,
just in his dealings, steadfast in his engagements and sincere in his
affections; he will enjoy a moderate state of health.</p>

<p>If the forehead is flat in the middle, the gentleman or lady will
be found to be vainglorious and but little disposed to generosity;
very tenacious of his honor, but brave; he will be fond of prying
into the secrets of others, though not with the intention of betraying
them; he will be fond of reading newspapers, history, novels,
and plays; ardent, and very cautious of his own reputation.</p>

<p>If there be a hollow across the forehead, in the middle, with a
ridge as of flesh, above, and another below, the gentleman will be
a good scholar, and the lady a great manufacturer, or attentive to
whatever occupation she may be engaged in. They will be warm
in argument or debate; they will be firm and steady in any point
they fix their minds upon and by their perseverance will generally
carry their object; yet they will meet with many crosses, but will
bear them with patience.</p>

<p>If the forehead juts out immediately at and over the eyebrows,
running flat up to the hair, the gentleman or lady will be sullen,
proud, insolent, imperious and treacherous; they will be impatient
when contradicted, apt to give great abuse, and to strike if they
think they can do it with advantage. They will also impose upon
any person, never forgive any injury and by their misconduct
make themselves many enemies.</p>

<p>If the temples are hollow, with the bones advancing towards
the forehead on either side, so that the space between must be
necessarily flat, with a small channel or indentation rising from the
upper part of the nose to the hair, the gentleman or lady will be of
a daring and intrepid temper, introducing themselves into matters
where they have no business, desirous of passing for wits, and of
a subtle and enterprising nature; greedy of praise, quick in quarrel,
and of a wandering disposition; very lewd, and full of resentment
when they feel their pride hurt. In short, they delight in
mischief, riots, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the eyebrows are very hairy, and that hair long and curled,
with several of the hairs starting out, the gentleman or lady is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a gloomy disposition, litigious and quarrelsome, although a coward;
greedy after the affairs of this world, perpetually brooding
over some melancholy subject and not an agreeable companion.
He will be diffident, penurious, and weak in his understanding;
never addicted to any kind of learning. He will pretend much
friendship, but will make his affected passion subservient to his
pecuniary designs, and given to drinking, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If a gentleman or lady has long eyebrows, with some long hairs,
they will be of a fickle disposition, weak-minded, credulous and
vain, always seeking after novelties and neglecting their own business;
they will be talkative, pert, and disagreeable in company;
very fond of contradiction, and will not bear disappointment
patiently; and also much addicted to drinking, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the eyebrows are thick and even, that is, without any or few
starting hairs, the lady or gentleman will be of an agreeable temper,
sound understanding and tolerable wit; moderately addicted
to pleasure, fearful of giving offence, but intrepid and persevering
in support of right; charitable and generous, sincere in their professions
of love and friendship and enjoy a good constitution.</p>

<p>If the eyebrow is small, thin of hair, and even, the lady or gentleman
will be weak-minded, timorous, superficial and not to be
depended on; they will be desirous of knowledge, but will not
have patience and assiduity to give it the necessary attention;
they will be desirous of praise for worthy actions, but will not
have the spirit or perseverance to perform them in that degree of
excellence that is requisite to attract the notice of wise men. They
will be of a delicate constitution.</p>

<p>If the eyebrow is thick of hair towards the nose and goes off
suddenly very thin, ending in a point, the lady or gentleman will
be surly, capricious, jealous, fretful and easily provoked to rage;
in their love they will be intemperate.</p>

<p>The eye that is large, full, prominent and clear, denotes a lady
or gentleman to be of an ingenious and candid disposition, void of
deceit and of an even, agreeable and affable disposition; modest
and bashful in love, though by no means an enemy to its gratification;
firm, though not obstinate; of a good understanding, of
an agreeable but not brilliant wit; but clear and just in argument;
inclined to extravagance and easily imposed upon.</p>

<p>The eye that is small, but advanced in the head, shows the lady
or gentleman to be of a quick wit, sound constitution, lively genius,
agreeable company and conversation, good morals, but rather inclined
to jealousy; attentive to business, fond of frequently changing
his place, punctual in fulfilling his engagements, warm in love,
prosperous in his undertakings and generally fortunate in most
things.</p>

<p>The lady or gentleman whose eyes are sunk in the head is of a
jealous, distrustful, malicious and envious nature; deceitful in
their words and actions, never to be depended upon; cunning in
overreaching others, vainglorious and associates with lewd and bad
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentleman or lady who squints, or have their eyes turned
awry, will be of a penurious disposition, but punctual in their
dealings.</p>

<p>A black eye is lively, brisk and penetrating, and proves the person
who possesses it to be of a sprightly wit, lively conversation,
not easily imposed upon, of a sound understanding, but if taken on
the weak side, may be led astray for a while.</p>

<p>A hazel eye shows the person to be of a subtle, piercing and
frolicsome turn, rather inclined to be arch, and sometimes mischievous,
but good-natured at the bottom. He will be strongly
inclined to love and not over delicate in the means of gratifying
that propensity.</p>

<p>A blue eye shows the person to be of a meek and gentle temper,
affable and good-natured, credulous and incapable of violent
attachment; over-modest, cool and undisturbed by turbulent passions,
of a strong memory, in constitution neither robust nor delicate,
subject to no violent impression from the vicissitudes of life,
whether good or bad.</p>

<p>A gray eye denotes the person to be of weak intellect, devoid of
wit, but a plain, plodding, downright drudge, that will act as he is
spirited by others. He will be slow in learning anything that
requires attention; he, however, will be just to the best of his
understanding.</p>

<p>A wall eye denotes the person to be of a hasty, passionate and
ungovernable temper, subject to sudden and violent anger; haughty
to his equals and superiors, but mild and affable to his inferiors.</p>

<p>A red, or as it is vulgarly called, a saucer eye, denotes the
person to be selfish, deceitful and proud; furious in anger, fertile
in the invention of plots and indefatigable in his resolution to bring
them to bear.</p>

<p>A nose that comes even on the ridge, flat on the sides, with
little or no hollow between the eyes, declares the man to be sulky,
insolent, disdainful, treacherous and self-sufficient; if it has a point
descending over the nostrils, he is avaricious and unfeeling, vainglorious
and ignorant; peevish, jealous, quick in resentment, yet
a coward at the bottom.</p>

<p>A nose that rises with a sudden bulge a little below the eyes,
and then falls again into a kind of hollow below, is petulant and
noisy, void of science and of a very light understanding.</p>

<p>The nose that is small, slender and peaked, shows the person to
be of a fearful disposition, jealous, fretful and insidious, ever suspicious
of those about him, catching at every word that he can
interpret to his own advantage to ground his dispute upon and also
very curious to know what is said and done.</p>

<p>The nose that is small, tapering round in the nostrils and cocked
up, shows the person to be ingenious, smart, of a quick apprehension,
giddy and seldom looking into consequences; but generous,
agreeable, so as to carefully avoid giving offence; but resolute in
doing himself justice when he receives an injury.</p>

<p>The lips that are thick, soft and long, announce the person to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
be of weak intellect, credulous and slightly peevish, but by a little
soothing easily brought back to a good humor. He is much
addicted to the pleasures of love, and scarcely moderate in his enjoyment
of them; yet he is upright in his conduct and of a timorous
temper.</p>

<p>If the under lip is much thicker than the upper, and more
prominent, the person is of a weak understanding, but artful,
knavish and given to chicanery to the full extent of his ability.</p>

<p>The lips that are moderately plump and even, declare the person
to be good-humored, humane, sensible, judicious and just,
neither giddy nor torpid, but pursuing in every particular a just
medium.</p>

<p>The lips that are thin, show the person to be of a quick and
lively imagination, ardent in the pursuit of knowledge, indefatigable
in labor, not too much attached to money, eager in the
pursuit of love, more brave than otherwise and tolerably happy in
life.</p>

<p>The lips that are thin and sunk inwards, denote the person to
be of a subtle and persevering disposition, everlasting in hatred
and never sparing any pains to compass his revenge; in love or
friendship much more moderate and uncertain.</p>

<p>The chin that is round, with a hollow between it and the lip,
shows the person to be of a good-humored disposition, kind and
honest; he is sincere in his friendship and ardent in his love; his
understanding is good and his genius capacious. If he has a dimple
it makes him better.</p>

<p>The chin that comes down flat from the edge of the lips and
ends in a kind of a chisel form, shows the person to be silly, credulous,
ill-tempered and greedy of unmerited honors; captious, wavering
and unsteady; he will affect great modesty in the presence
of others, though he will not scruple to do the vilest actions when
he thinks himself secure from discovery.</p>

<p>The chin that is pointed upwards shows the person to be much
given to contrivances. However fair he may speak to you, you
can never depend on his friendship, as his purpose is only to make
you subservient to his own designs. In love his generosity will be
of the same stamp.</p>

<p>Of the face in general, the person whose features are strong,
coarse and unpleasant to the eye, is of a selfish, brutal, rough and
unsocial disposition; greedy of money, harsh in expressions, but
will sometimes fawn with a bad grace to gain his ends.</p>

<p>The face that is plump, round and ruddy, denotes the person to
be of an agreeable temper, a safe companion, hearty, jovial, fond of
company, of sound principles and a clear understanding, faithful
in love, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The face that is thin, smooth and even, with well-proportioned
features, shows the person to be of a good disposition, but penetrative
and active; somewhat inclined to suspicion, yet of an agreeable
conversation; assiduous in the pursuits of love and strongly
addicted to the delights of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>A face whose cheek bones jut out with thin jaws, is of a restless
and thinking disposition; fretful, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A face that is pale by nature, denotes a timorous disposition,
but greatly desirous of carnal pleasures.</p>

<p>A face that is unequally red, whether streaked or appearing in
spots, shows the person to be weak both in body and mind, yielding
easily to affliction and sickness.</p>

<p>A face blotched shows the person to be addicted to drinking
and vice, though frequently possessing the art to conceal the inclination
therefor.</p>

<p>The head that is large and round shows that the person has a
tolerable understanding, but not near so good as he imagines.</p>

<p>The head that is small and round, or if the face comes tapering,
shows the person of an acute, penetrating disposition, much given
to bantering humor, but of great sensibility.</p>

<p>The head that is flat on either side, and deep from the face to
the back, shows the person to be of a good understanding, deep
penetration, great memory and of an agreeable temper; of slow
belief and not easily imposed upon.</p>

<p>Big and broad ears signify a simple man, of no understanding;
sluggish, slothful and of an ill memory. Small ears denote a good
understanding; but very small ears signify nothing but mischief
and malice. Those that have them well proportioned, and neither
too small nor too large, are persons of good understanding, wise,
discreet, honest, shamefaced and courageous. Those that have
them somewhat long and thin, are bold, impudent, unlearned, gluttons
and very proud and scornful.</p>

<p>A thin, soft beard denotes a person lustful and effeminate, of a
tender body, fearful, delicate and inconstant.</p>

<p>A red beard denotes first, a placid forehead, and the person is
courteous and friendly, but not without some craft; is a very great
flatterer, very soon angry and affects consequence.</p>

<p>A dark beard is good, but the possessor is usually of a melancholy
disposition; yet it denotes a person to be ingenious, sincere,
thoughtful, constant, cordial, bold and fit to make a warrior.</p>

<p>A pale beard denotes a phlegmatic person, who is temperate
enough and tolerably prudent.</p>

<p>He that hath a decent beard, handsome and thick of hair, is
good-natured and reasonable in all things.</p>

<p>Those who have little or no beard, but a small mustache, are of
an ill humor, but very luxurious.</p>

<p>The practical part of chiromancy is that which gathers probable
predictions from lines, the places of the planets in the hand, and
from the notes and characters everywhere posted and marked out
in the hands and fingers. These lines and their planetary relevancy
are thus defined:</p>

<p>The question often arises as to whether judgment should be
given by the right hand or the left. It is certain that in one hand
the lines and other signatures are very often more manifest, and
are thus more plain to be seen than the other, as well in the hands
of gentlemen as ladies. That hand is the proper one (in both sexes)
which shows and exhibits the lines thereof most clearly, and
abounds with a series of characters and signs, yet so as that the
other, whose lines are more obscure, may pay its contribution. If
in both hands they consent, and appear to be fair and comely,
they declare a constancy of fortune and health. The cause of diversity
is that he who is born in the daytime, and has a masculine
planet (the Sun, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars) lord of his geniture,
bears the more remarkable signs in his right hand, especially when
the sign ascending is also masculine. The contrary happens to
those born at night, as often as a feminine planet predominates.
If both hands agree, it must be that in a diurnal nativity the feminine
planets rule, or that there falls out a mixture of masculine
and feminine; so in the nights by the contrary reason.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;OF THE LINE OF LIFE.
THIS IS CALLED CARDIACA, OR THE HEART LINE.</h3>

<p>This being broad, of a lively color, and decently drawn in its
bounds, without intersections and points, shows the party long
lived and subject to few diseases.</p>

<p>If slender, short and dissected with obverse little lines, and deformed
either by a pale or black color, it presages weakness of the
body, sickness and a short life.</p>

<p>If orderly joined to the natural mean, and beautified in the
angle with parallels, or a little across, it argues good wit, or an
evenness of nature.</p>

<p>If the same have branches in the upper parts thereof, extending
themselves towards the natural mean, it signifies riches and honor.</p>

<p>If these branches be extended towards the restricta, it threatens
poverty, deceits, and unfaithfulness of servants.</p>

<p>If in this line there be found some confused lines, like hairs, be
assured of diseases, and they happen in the first age. When they
appear below, if towards the cavea, in the middle; if towards the
patica, in the declining age.</p>

<p>If this line be anywhere broken, it threatens extreme danger of
life in that part of the age which the pace of the breach shows.
For you may find out the dangerous or diseased years of your age;
this line being divided into seventy parts, you must begin your number
and account from the lower part thereof, near the restricta, for
the number falling where the branch is determines the year.</p>

<p>If the character of the sun (as commonly it is made by astrologers)
be ever found in this line, it presages the loss of an eye;
but, if two such characters, the loss of both eyes.</p>

<p>A line descending from the vital, beneath the congress of it and
the hepatica, to the tuberculum of Saturn, shows an envious man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who rejoices at another’s calamity, the sight of others concurring.
This also frequently shows a most perilous Saturnine disease in
that wherein it touches the vital, and it is much worse if it cut the
same.</p>

<p>But such a line passing from the vital to the annular, to the ring
finger, promises honors to ensue, from or by the means of some
famous lady.</p>

<p>The vital lines being thicker than ordinary at the end under the
fore finger, denotes a laborious old age.</p>

<p>A line passing through the vitals to the cavea of Mars, foretells
of wounds and fevers, and also of misfortunes in journeys.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;OF THE HEPATICA, OR NATURAL MEAN.</h3>

<p>This line being straight, continued, and not dissected by obverse
little lines, denotes a healthful body.</p>

<p>If it be short or broken, and reach not beyond the concave of
the hand, it shows diseases and shortness of life.</p>

<p>By how much more the same is produced, by so much longer
the life may be warranted.</p>

<p>If cut at the end thereof by a small intervening line, it threatens
poverty in old age.</p>

<p>If in the upper part it be distant from the vital by a great space,
it shows distemperatures of the heart, as palpitations, syncope, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This also shows prodigality, especially if the table be broad.</p>

<p>If tortuous (that is, if it wind and turn several ways), unequal,
of a different color and dissected, it argues an evil constitution of
the liver, and thence diseases, proceeding from the weakness thereof.
Covetousness also, and a depravity both of nature and wit,
especially if it be under the region of the middle finger, and near
the cardiaca, thereby making a short or narrow triangle.</p>

<p>If decently drawn and well colored, it is a sign of a cheerful
and ingenious disposition.</p>

<p>If it has a sister, it promises inheritances.</p>

<p>If continued with some little hard knots, it denotes manslaughters,
either perpetrated, or to be committed, according to the number
of these said knots.</p>

<p>If therein a cross be found under the region of the middle finger,
it announces death to be at hand.</p>

<p>If it terminates with a fork towards the ferient, it is a sign of
depraved wit, of hypocrisy, and of evil manners.</p>

<p>When it tends to the mensa, it is a token of a slanderous tongue
and of envy.</p>

<p>When it projects a remarkable cleft through the vital to the
mons veneris, and the sister of Mars, especially if the same be of a
ruddy color, it warns you to beware of thieves, and also intimates
fraud and deceit of enemies.</p>

<p>This cleft likewise insinuates a most vehement heat of the liver,
proceeding from the rays of Mars; so that the life becomes in
danger, seeing that the line of life is dissected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>This line having some branch, yet such a one as nevertheless
seems to be continued, shows that the manner of life will be, or is
already changed; and this in a declining age if the breach be under
the ring finger; but, if under the middle finger, in strength of
years.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;OF THE CEPHALICA.</h3>

<p>This is called the line of the head and brain, which, if (arising
from its place in a due proportion) it connects the lines of the liver
and heart in a triangular form, have a lively color, and no intersection
falling out between, declares a man of admirable prudence,
and one of no vulgar wit and fortune.</p>

<p>By how much more decent the triangle is, so much the better
shall the temperature, wit and courage be; but if it be obtuse, it
argues an evil disposed nature, and a man that is rude; if no triangle,
far worse.</p>

<p>The superior being a right angle, or not very acute, foretells the
best temperature of the heart; but when it is too acute, especially
if it touch the line of life, upon the region of the middle finger, it
argues covetousness.</p>

<p>The left angle, if it be made upon the natural mean in the ferient,
and be a right angle, confirms the goodness of intellect.</p>

<p>But when the cephalica projects unequal clefts to the mons
lunæ, thereby making unusual characters, in the gentleman it denotes
weakness of the brain, and dangerous sea voyages. But in
the lady’s hand it shows frequent sorrows of mind, and difficulties
in child bearing.</p>

<p>Equal lines (thus projected) presage the contrary in both sexes,
viz., in gentlemen, a good composure of the brain, and fortunate
voyages by sea; in ladies, cheerfulness and felicity in child bearing.</p>

<p>This one thing is peculiar to the cephalica: if it project a cleft
or a manifest star, upwards to the cavea martis, it signifies boldness,
&amp;c. But if it let fall the same downwards, thefts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The cephalica, jointed to the dragon’s tail by a remarkable concourse,
promises a prudent and a joyful age.</p>

<p>The same drawn upwards in the shape of a fork, towards the
part of fortune, signifies subtlety in managing affairs, and also
craftiness either to do good or evil.</p>

<p>If in this said fork a mark appears resembling the part of fortune,
as it is noticed by astrologers, that gives an assurance of
riches and honor to succeed by ingenuity and art.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;OF THE THORAL LINE.</h3>

<p>This is also called the line of fortune; it is termed likewise the
mensa, because it makes up the table of the hand. Which said
line, when it is long enough, and without incisures, argues a due
strength in the principal members of man, and also constancy;
the contrary if it be short, crooked, cut or parted.</p>

<p>If it terminate under the mount of Saturn, it shows a vain fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>If projecting small branches to the mount of Jupiter, it promises
honors.</p>

<p>If there it be naked and simple, it is a sign of poverty and want.</p>

<p>If cutting the mouth of Jupiter, cruelty of mind and disposition,
with excessive wrath.</p>

<p>If it projects a branch between the fore and middle finger in a
gentleman, it threatens a wound in his head; in a lady, danger in
child bearing.</p>

<p>Three lines ascending upwards from this line, viz., one to the
space between the middle and fore finger, a second to the space between
the middle and ring finger, and a third to the space between
the ring and the little finger, argues a contentious person in many
respects.</p>

<p>A little line only thus drawn to the interval or space between
the middle finger and the ring finger, sorrow or labor.</p>

<p>If annexed to the natural mean, so that it makes an acute angle,
it brings sorrow and labor.</p>

<p>If the natural mean be wanting, and the thoral annexed to the
vital, it threatens decollation or a deadly wound.</p>

<p>If no mensa at all, it shows a man malevolent, contentious,
faithless, inconstant and of base condition.</p>

<p>Confused little lines in the mensa, denote sickness; if under
Mercury, in the former part of the age; under the sun in the prime
thereof; under the middle finger, in old age.</p>

<p>When in this line there are certain points observed, they argue
strength of the genitals and burning lust.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;OF THE CAUDA DRACONIS, OR THE RESTRICTA,
AND THE LINES ARISING THEREFROM.</h3>

<p>If this be double or treble, and drawn by a right and continued
track, it promises a good composure of the body.</p>

<p>That line which is nearest the hand continued, and of a good
color, assures great riches.</p>

<p>But if the same line be cut in the middle, crooked and very
pale, it announces debility of body and want of all things.</p>

<p>A cross or star upon the restricta, foreshadows tranquility of
life in old age.</p>

<p>If there be a star, simple or double, or any lines near the tuberculum
of the thumb, in ladies, they denote misfortune or infamy.</p>

<p>A line running from the restricta through the mons veneris,
presages adversities, either by the means of some kindred or a wife.</p>

<p>A line extending from the restricta to the mons lunæ, denotes
adversities and private enemies; if it be crooked, it doubles the
evil, and betokens perpetual servitude.</p>

<p>Such a line also being clear and straight, and reaching as far
as the region of the moon, foretells many journeys by sea and land.</p>

<p>If it extend to the tuberculum of the fore finger, it informs the
gentleman that he shall live in a foreign country in great estimation.</p>

<p>If to the hepatica, it argues honest behavior, and prolongs life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>If to the mons solis (be it simple or double), it argues exceeding
goodness, and enables to govern or rule in great affairs.</p>

<p>By the same reason, if it pass to the mons Mercurii, it betokens
the gentleman is of a sufficient capacity for any employment;
but if it reach not the mons Mercurii, but is broken about the
middle and end beneath the mons Mercurii, that makes out a prating
fellow, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If directly ascending to the mons Saturni, it signifies a good
position of Saturn in the geniture, whose decree shall shortly follow;
but, if crookedly towards the restricta and the hepatica especially,
it shows man laborious, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;OF THE VIA SOLIS, OR THE SUN’S WAY.</h3>

<p>This being whole, equally drawn and well colored, promises
the favor of great men and great honor; but, if dissected and
unequal, the contrary, and exposes to divers impediments, and
envy in attaining the same.</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;OF THE VIA LACTEA, OR THE MILKY WAY.</h3>

<p>This well proportioned and continued, presages that journeys
will be fortunate both by sea and land, as ready wit and the favor
of the ladies (Venus assenting), and of a composed and graceful
speech; but if it be distorted, it argues infelicity and lies; but
whole and ascending to the little finger, it is a sign of happiness.</p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;OF THE SATURNIA, OR LINE OF SATURN.</h3>

<p>This being wholly and fully protracted to the middle finger, is
an argument both of profound cogitations and likewise of fortunate
events in counsels and actions.</p>

<p>Combust or deficient, an evil sign, portending many misfortunes,
unless other positions favor it.</p>

<p>Bending backwards in the cavea of the hand, towards the ferient,
in the form of a semi-circle, threatens imprisonment.</p>

<p>A line drawn from the vital, through the hepatica, to the tuberculum
of Saturn (if it touch the Saturnia), the same.</p>

<h3>IX.&mdash;OF THE CINGULUM VENERIS, OR THE GIRDLE
OF VENUS.</h3>

<p>If this line have a sister, it argues intemperance and lust in both
sexes, and baseness in the gratification of lewd desires; and if
dissected and carefully examined, it shows losses and infamy by
reason of this vice.</p>

<h3>X.&mdash;OF THE VIA MARTIS, THE WAY OR LINE OF
MARS, OR THE VITAL SISTER.</h3>

<p>This line (as often as it appears), augments and strengthens
the things signified by the cardiaca; but particularly it promises
good success in war, provided it be clear and red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3>SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING LINES.</h3>

<p>The quantity of lines must be wisely observed, that is, the
length and depth, so likewise their quality, that is, their complexion
and shape, whether they are crooked or straight; next their
action, which is to touch or cut other lines. Their passion to be
touched or cut of others; and lastly, their place and position.</p>

<p>We must know that the lines are sometimes prolonged until
certain years of our age, otherwise shortened; now they wax pale,
then they become plain and strong, and as it were luxuriate with a
kind of redness, and this as well in the principal as less principal
lines. Again, as touching the less principal, and such as are found
in the tubercula of the planets, it is most certain that some do at
one time quite vanish, and that at another time others arise of a
different shape and complexion; the cause of which is supposed
to be no other than the various progressions of the alphabetical
places in their nativities; that is, fortunate and unfortunate to the
influence whereof man himself is wonderfully subject. The signs
of his hands are presented at different times with different faces.
<em>Such a virtue, such a love resideth in the imagination of the greater
world towards the lesser.</em> And, therefore, the most studious in chiromancy
cannot attain the knowledge of particulars by one inspection
only, made to a certain year of the person’s age; things
that worthily merit our observations, yet known or approved of by
a few.</p>

<h3>OF THE PLANETS.</h3>

<p>The planets also administer not a little judgment from their respective
places, for if they are happy and benevolent, good things
are portended, but being unhappy and froward, judge the contrary.
Here we must also note that these planets are termed benevolent, in
whose tubercula and places the accustomed lines are found equal,
their characters fair and proportionable, as a cross, stars, three or
four parallel lines, ladders, little branches, a quadrangular, the
character of Jupiter. But the froward and unfortunate are those
planets whose tubercula and places are deformed with troubled
lines and uncouth figures; as a lame and interrupted semi-circle
gridirons the character of Saturn. This is to be duly observed in
the lines of the hand. Now, as touching the planets, let us proceed
according to the general rules of art.</p>

<h3>XI.&mdash;OF VENUS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Venus</span> shining well and happily (that is) when in her tuberculum,
she presents a clear star, or furrows that are red and transversely
parallel, and so often as her tuberculum is much elevated,
makes such men to be merry, cheerful and luxurious; yet amorous,
comely and libidinous, very honest and just, with whom an uninterrupted
tie of friendship once made is permanent.</p>

<p>She renders the body somewhat tall, the eyes pleasant and
sparkling with the splendor of beauty, full of allurement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
temptation, the hair thick and curling; she instills a spotless and
noble mind, yet oftentimes gives men that are full of boasting and
inconsistency. She inclines the mind to music, &amp;c.; sometimes
according to the strength of the geniture, she produces priests,
apothecaries, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But being unfortunate, she causes lasciviousness, incontinency
and boasting, and if you find a cross also, near the first joint of
the thumb, it denotes an adulterer, or such a person on whom a
misfortune has happened in some luxurious matter. If the place
of Venus be untilled, it points out an effeminate, rude and sorrowful
person, foolishly and ridiculously addicted to be merry and
jesting.</p>

<h3>XII.&mdash;MARS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mars</span> is fortunate, so often as his sister appears red, clear and
decently drawn, and when either star or cross is found in his cavea.
Thus, therefore, he denotes such as are bold and full of courage,
stout, warlike, contentious, strong and lusty; imperious; the hair
for the most part yellow; the eyes from black waxing red and
terrible. If Jupiter participate, he possesses the gall, the reins, the
back, the liver, &amp;c. If with Venus, those parts of the body
under her dominion. But if he be froward and unfortunate, he
describes men to be litigious, violent, deceitful, passionate, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>XIII.&mdash;JUPITER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Jupiter</span> is happy or fortunate when in his region he exhibits
signs that are auspicious&mdash;that is, if there be a star or double cross,
parallel lines, or a line decently drawn from the vital to his
tuberculum, &amp;c. For thus he signifies men that are noble, honest,
benevolent, affable, honorable, merry, just, equitable, beautiful,
formidable and happy, such as have comely eyes, thick hairs
and a grave gesture; likewise such as are bashful, and likewise
such as will keep their promises, &amp;c. These men are preferred
to great dignities, and solicited by many great men, and do highly
favor and esteem their wives, sons, honest and good men. In
men, Jupiter rules the liver, blood, ribs, lungs and gristles. But,
if he is unfortunate, he oftentimes throws a man headlong from a
great estate to great calamities; if there be half a gridiron in his
tuberculum, it betokens losses, especially by means of the more
potent sort of women; otherwise thus constituted, he causes grief
of the heart, cramps, inflammations of the lungs and other diseases
proceeding from wind; if a line transversely cut his tuberculum,
and afterwards tend to the place of Saturn, making those
little hairs, it threatens apoplexy. But, if you find a cross especially,
or a clear and red star in his tuberculum, he gives splendid
honors, confers riches and public rewards from great personages or
princes.</p>

<h3>XIV.&mdash;SATURN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Saturn</span> is happily placed when we find his line wholly running
to his region, but less happy when he presents some inauspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
characters; unhappily, if he shows confused and unfortunate
signs; he governs the spleen, bones and bladder. When he is
fortunate he makes men silent, provident, of good and profound
counsels, such as think and study much and are somewhat sorrowful;
men that are puffed up with an ambitious spirit, and whose
aim is honors. And these are slender of body, somewhat tall, pale
and feeble, their hair blackish, eyes hollow; they are fortunate in
tilling of ground, and in metals of all sorts, yet more careless of
their wives, and less addicted to the pleasures of love; foolishly
laughing and jesting, also tenacious and worldly minded, unjust,
&amp;c. But, if Saturn be unfortunate or froward, he makes men
sorrowful, laborious, sordid, humble, covetous, liars, malicious,
envious, &amp;c., and encumbered with perpetual griefs and anxieties.</p>

<p>A gross line running from the interval of the middle and fore
finger to the mensa, and breaking or interrupting it, denotes diseases
or wounds in the lower part of the body.</p>

<h3>XV.&mdash;SOL.</h3>

<p>If the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> fortunately rules, he makes men faithful, ingenious,
honored, high minded, wise, humane, religious, just, moderate,
aged, and such as always manage their affairs honestly. He gives
a body well composed, and adorns it with yellow hair; he governs
the heart, midriff, nerves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But, if unfortunate, he gives men that are proud and highly
elated, manifesting their access to dignities by unjust means,
boasters and immodest. He brings fluxes of rheum upon the eyes,
and thereby hurts both them and the mouth, trembling of the
heart, syncope, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>XVI.&mdash;LUNA.</h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Moon</span> happy and fortunate, makes men famous, honest
and honorable and of a large body; yet well proportioned, pleasant
also, and sometimes voyages by sea and walking by the sides of
rivers; but, if any way dissenting in the other, unconstant both in
life and action, yet tending for the most part to the best. She
rules the brain, stomach and belly, but if unfortunate she portends
a various and inconstant kind of line, weakness, and increase of
griefs and anxieties, she thus causes paralysis, &amp;c. A commotion
of the members, oftentimes an epilepsy and canker, spots in the
body, severe colic, and whatever else proceeds from abundance of
cold and moisture, and more especially when the lines found in
the tuberculum of the moon do appear very pale; if there be fair
and comely signatures near the ferient, they denote happiness to
the man in his journeys and messages, and in foreign countries.
To the woman, felicity and fertility in bearing of children, ominous
signs do show the contrary.</p>

<h3>XVII.&mdash;MERCURY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mercury</span>, happy and fortunate, makes men ingenious, desirous
of science, and seeking diligently after secrets, such as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
apt for any thing, orators, poets, philosophers, astrologicians, fortune-tellers,
eloquent, variable, mathematicians, and men addicted
to merchandise, &amp;c. He governs the tongue and memory.</p>

<h3>XVIII.&mdash;THE MENSA, OR PART OF FORTUNE.</h3>

<p>This space being great and broad, and the figure decent, declares
a liberal man, magnanimous and of long life.</p>

<p>But if small and narrow, it indicates a slender fortune and fearfulness.</p>

<p>A cross or star within it, clear and well proportioned, especially
under the region of the ring finger, betokens honors and dignities
to ensue from, or by means of great and noble personages. If the
character of Jupiter, it then promises great ecclesiastical dignities,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The same star or cross tripled, portends good fortune; but if it
be cut by confused little lines, the good fortune is thereby diverted,
and anxieties and labors threatened in defending his honors, especially
if they are under the region of the ring finger.</p>

<p>A cross or star in the uppermost part of the mensa, is a sign of
fortunate journeys.</p>

<p>The mensa sharpened by the concourse of the thoral and cardiac
lines, points out deceit and danger of life.</p>

<p>If no mensa be shown in the hand, it shows obscurity both of
life and fortune.</p>

<p>Good and equal lines in this space do declare the fortune to be
good, but if evil and decomposed they quite overthrow it.</p>

<p>A little circle shows perfection of wit, and the obtaining of
science, the others assenting thereunto.</p>

<h3>XIX.&mdash;THE POLLEX, OR THUMB.</h3>

<p>Overthwart lines, that are clear and long underneath the nail
and joint of the thumb, confer riches and honor. A line passing
from the upper joint of the thumb to the cardiaca, threatens a violent
death or danger by means of some married lady. Lines much
dispersed in the lower joint of the thumb, describe men that are
contentious, and such as rejoice in scolding, &amp;c. A line surrounding
the thumb, in the middle joint, portends the man shall be
hanged. Equal furrows drawn under the lower joint thereof,
argue riches and possessions. If the first or second joint want incisures,
it shows drowsiness and idleness.</p>

<h3>XX.&mdash;THE INDEX, OR FORE FINGER.</h3>

<p>Many lines in the uppermost joint, and they proceeding overthwartly,
denote inheritances; by running so in the middle joint,
an envious and evil disposed person.</p>

<p>Right lines running between these joints, declare (in the ladies)
a numerous issue; in gentlemen, bitterness of tongue. If they are
in the first joint, near unto Jupiter’s mouth, they manifest a jovial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
disposition, that is, they point to the man whom Jupiter favored
well in his nativity. That who hath a star in the same place, may
certainly be pronounced unchaste and lascivious.</p>

<h3>XXI.&mdash;MEDIUS, OR THE MIDDLE FINGER.</h3>

<p>This finger presenting little gridirons in the joints thereof,
plainly declares an unhappy and melancholy wit, but if equal
lines, it manifests fortune by metals, &amp;c. A star there presages a
violent death by drowning, &amp;c. If a gross line be extended from
the root thereof, upwards, through the whole finger into the end
of the last joint, it argues folly and madness.</p>

<h3>XXII.&mdash;ANNULARIS, OR THE RING FINGER.</h3>

<p>A line arising from mons solis, and ascending by a right track
through the joints thereof, it shows a noble frame. Equal lines in
the first joint demonstrate honors and riches; overthwart lines,
the enmity of great men. Howbeit, if these lines be intersected, it
is better, because they argue impediments.</p>

<h3>XXIII.&mdash;AURICULARIS, OR LITTLE FINGER.</h3>

<p>From the joint thereof, as from the mouth itself, are judgments
and decrees passed concerning merchandise, favors, and a
star in its first joint near the tuberculum, argues ingenuity and
eloquence.</p>

<p>Other obtuse signs the contrary, but when there appear unfortunate
signs in the first and second joints, they mark out a thief
and a very deceitful person. If adverse lines in the last joint, perpetual
inconstancy.</p>

<p>Some there are who predict the number of wives from the little
lines in the mons Mercurii at the outermost part of the hand, and
have often observed them come at the truth.</p>

<p>If the end of this finger reach not so far as to touch the last
joint of the ring finger, it signifies a wife most imperious in all
things, the truth thereof is often proved.</p>

<h3>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE MOUNTS AND FINGERS.</h3>

<p>As the mounts being adorned with good figures and characters
indicate a good and happy issue, so likewise being vitiated with
confused lines, they threaten the contrary, and this as well on the
fingers as mounts, except they are restrained by the confederacy of
other lines which are of themselves good and fortunate.</p>

<p>There are likewise the twelve signs of the Zodiac upon the fingers.
The signification of the lines proceeding from the mounts
of the different planets upon the fingers, show their effect chiefly
when the sun, or their principal significator, as lord of the ascendant,
&amp;c., is in these signs, ruling the parts where they terminate,
as a line passing from the mount of Saturn to the first point of the
middle finger would give improvement when the sun was in Pisces;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
if to the second, in Aquarius. Observe also that the first joint
near the mount of the finger must be attributed to the first part of
the age, the second to the prime of life, and the last unto old age.</p>

<p>Lastly. The structure of the hand itself is really admirable
in respect to the proportion it bears to the face, and certain parts
thereof, which is this:</p>

<p>The whole hand is of equal length with the face.</p>

<p>The greater joint of the forefinger (which adjoins upon the tuberculum
of Jupiter) equals the height of the forehead.</p>

<p>The other two (to the extremity of the nail) are just the length
of the nose, viz.: from the intercelia, or place between the eyebrows,
to the tip of the nostrils.</p>

<p>The first and greater joint of the middle finger is just as long as
it is between the bottom of the chin and the top of the under lip.</p>

<p>But the third joint of the same finger is of equal length with
the distance that is between the mouth and the lower part of the
nostrils.</p>

<p>The largest joint of the thumb gives the width of the mouth.</p>

<p>The distance between the bottom of the chin and the top of the
lower lip, the same.</p>

<p>The lesser joint of the thumb is equal to the distance between
the top of the lower lip and the lower part of the nostrils. The
nails obtain just the half of their respective uppermost joints,
which they call omychios.</p>

<h3>OF THE NAILS OF THE FINGERS.</h3>

<p>Broad nails show the person to be bashful and fearful, but of a
gentle nature. When there is a certain white mark at the extremity
of them, it shows that the person has more honesty than subtilty,
and that his worldly substance will be impaired through negligence.
White nails and long, denote much sickness and infirmity,
especially fevers, and are an indication of strength, and deceit in
women. If upon the white anything appears at the extremity that
is pale, it denotes short life by sudden death, and the person to be
given to melancholy. When there appear a sudden mixed redness
of divers colors at the beginning of the nail, it shows the person
to be choleric, and very quarrelsome. When the extremity is
black, it is a sign of husbandry. Narrow nails denote the person
to be inclined to mischief and to do injury to his neighbor.
Long nails show the person to be good natured, but mistrustful,
and loves reconciliation rather than differences. Oblique nails signify
deceit and want of courage. Little and round nails denote
obstinate anger and hatred; if they be crooked at the extremity,
they show pride and fierceness. Round nails show a choleric
person, yet soon reconciled and a lover of secret sciences. Fleshy
nails denote the person to be mild in temper, idle and lazy.
Pale and black nails show the person to be very deceitful to his
neighbor, and subject to many diseases. Red and marked nails
signify a choleric and martial nature, given to cruelty: and as
many little marks as there are, they speak of so many evil desires.</p>

<h2>CELESTIAL PALMISTRY.</h2>

<p>The Moon exercises an influence over the children of men,
which varies with her monthly age, in like manner as that of the
sun is varied according to his progress through the signs of the
zodiac. Her term is completed in thirty days and recurs twelve
times annually. The probable fate of each individual through
life is to be gathered from the aspect of the day on which he was
born; and the issue of any particular event or undertaking from
the day of its occurrence or transaction or commencement; counting
in both cases from the <em>new moon</em>, as is shown in the following
calendar. She has power over dreams and visions; and exercises
it more particularly on certain days.</p>

<p>A child born within twenty-four hours after the new moon will
be fortunate and live to a good old age. Whatever is dreamed on
that day will be pleasing to the dreamer.</p>

<p>The second day is very lucky for discovering things lost, or
hidden treasure; the child born on this day will thrive.</p>

<p>The child born on the third day will be fortunate through persons
in power, and whatever is dreamed will prove true.</p>

<p>The fourth day is evil; persons falling sick on this day rarely
recover.</p>

<p>The fifth day is favorable to begin a good work and dreams
will be tolerably successful; the child born on this day will be
vain and deceitful.</p>

<p>The child born on the sixth day will not live long, and his
dreams will not immediately come to pass.</p>

<p>On the seventh day do not tell your dreams, for much depends
on concealing them; if sickness befalls you on this day you will
soon recover; the child born on this day will live long, but have
many troubles.</p>

<p>On the eighth day whatever is dreamed will come to pass;
whatever business a person undertakes on this day will prosper.</p>

<p>The ninth day differs very little from the former; the child
born on this day will arrive at great riches and honor.</p>

<p>The tenth day is likely to be fatal to those who fall sick; but
the child born on this day will live long and be a great traveler.</p>

<p>The child that is born on the eleventh day will be much devoted
to religion, and of an engaging form and manners.</p>

<p>On the twelfth day dreams are rather fortunate and the child
born then shall live long.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth day the dreams will prove true in a very short
time.</p>

<p>If you ask a favor of any one on the fourteenth day, it will be
granted.</p>

<p>The sickness that befalls a person on the fifteenth day is likely
to prove mortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The child that is born on the sixteenth day will be of very ungraceful
manners and unfortunate; it is nevertheless a good day
for buying and selling merchandise.</p>

<p>The child born on the seventeenth day will be very foolish; it
is a very unfortunate day to transact any kind of business or contract
marriage.</p>

<p>The child born on the eighteenth day will be valiant, but will
suffer considerable hardships; if a female, she will be chaste and
industrious and live respected to a great age.</p>

<p>The nineteenth day is dangerous; the child born during it will
be very ill-disposed and malicious.</p>

<p>On the twentieth day the dreams are true, but the child born
during it will be dishonest.</p>

<p>The child born on the twenty-first day will grow up healthy
and strong, but selfishly inclined and of low habits.</p>

<p>The child born on the twenty-second day will be fortunate; he
or she will be of cheerful countenance, religious, and much beloved.</p>

<p>The child that is born on the twenty-third day will be of an
ungovernable temper, will forsake his friends and wander about in
a foreign country, unhappy through life.</p>

<p>The child born on the twenty-fourth day will achieve many
heroic actions and be much admired for his extraordinary abilities.</p>

<p>The child born on the twenty-fifth day will be very wicked; he
will meet with many dangers and will probably come to an ill end.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth day the dreams are certain; the child then
born will be rich and greatly esteemed.</p>

<p>The twenty-seventh day is very favorable for dreams, and the
child then born will be of a sweet and amiable disposition.</p>

<p>The child born on the twenty-eighth day will be the delight of
his parents, but will not live to a great age.</p>

<p>The child born on the twenty-ninth day will experience many
hardships, though in the end they may turn out happily. It is
good to marry on this day, and business begun on this day will be
prosperous.</p>

<p>And, finally, the child that is born on the thirtieth day will be
fortunate and happy and well skilled in arts and sciences.</p>

<h3>CHILDREN BORN ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.</h3>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;The child shall be of long life and obtain riches.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Weak and of an effeminate temper, which seldom
brings a man to honor.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Worse; though he may, with extraordinary vigilance,
conquer the inordinate desires to which he will be subject;
still he will be in danger of dying by violence, if he has not great
procreation.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;He shall be given to the study of learning and
shall profit thereby.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;He shall arrive at great honor and dignity.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;He shall be of a strong constitution, yet perhaps remarkably
lecherous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Is another bad day; but, notwithstanding, the child
may come to good, though it be seldom; but most children born
on this day are of a heavy, dull and very dogged disposition.</p>

<h3>SICKNESS&mdash;LUCKY AND UNLUCKY DAYS.</h3>

<p>Whoever, in the first day of any month, fall sick, or is attacked
with any infirmity, the third day ensuing is to be feared, which, if
he pass, he shall escape.</p>

<p>Those falling ill on the second day of any month, though they
be long confined, yet shall recover.</p>

<p>Any illness commencing on the third day will certainly terminate
favorably.</p>

<p>Those falling sick on the fourth day will probably linger until
the twenty-eighth, which, if they pass, may possibly recover.</p>

<p>Those taken ill on the fifth day may become very low, but will
recover.</p>

<p>Persons falling sick on the sixth day may recover, if they pass
the fifth day of the ensuing month, but they will stand a poor
chance of recovery.</p>

<p>The seventh is a lucky day, and one falling sick on this day may
recover, even though having to endure great suffering.</p>

<p>The eighth day is an unfortunate one, and those falling ill on it
will not be likely to survive.</p>

<p>Illness commencing on the ninth day will not usually prove fatal,
though sometimes so.</p>

<p>On the tenth day, the contrary.</p>

<p>The eleventh day is remarkably fortunate for those falling sick;
they will recover speedily.</p>

<p>It is a bad omen to be taken sick on the twelfth of any month;
for unless you recover within two or three days, you will most
certainly die within the year.</p>

<p>Those falling sick on the thirteenth day, if they pass five days,
they will quite likely recover.</p>

<p>The fourteenth is a lucky day, and those taken sick on it will
recover in forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>On the contrary, those falling ill on the fifteenth day may experience
long and lingering illness, which will probably prove fatal.</p>

<p>Those taken on the sixteenth day, may escape, after some weeks
of illness.</p>

<p>Persons falling ill on the seventeenth day are almost sure to die
within three weeks.</p>

<p>The eighteenth is a lucky day and those falling sick on that
day will undoubtedly recover.</p>

<p>The nineteenth, the same&mdash;though the sickness may last much
longer.</p>

<p>The twentieth is an uncertain day, and sickness commencing on
this day frequently terminates fatally, if it continue more than five
days.</p>

<p>The twenty-first day perils one’s life for ten days&mdash;that time
passed, you will recover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Those falling sick on the twenty-second, will die within forty-eight
hours, or after that time will certainly recover.</p>

<p>Those taken sick on the twenty-third will stand a chance of
lingering illness, which will probably terminate favorably.</p>

<p>The twenty-fourth is another unlucky day, and those falling ill
on that day, though they be partially restored, will probably die
within three months.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the twenty-fifth is a very favorable day, and
those falling sick will get well speedily.</p>

<p>The twenty-sixth portends a protracted illness, which will terminate
favorably.</p>

<p>The twenty-seventh threatens death, though the chances of recovery
are fair.</p>

<p>Those falling ill on the twenty-eighth, menace death.</p>

<p>Persons who are taken sick on the twenty-ninth day will have
a very protracted illness and recover slowly.</p>

<p>The thirtieth and thirty-first are uncertain days, and persons falling
sick on either of these days, it cannot be known whether they
will recover or not.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT ADVICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To Females.</span>&mdash;It has often been observed, and experience has
shown the observation to be a true one, that some event of importance
is sure to happen to a woman in her thirty-first year, whether
it prove for her good or it be some great evil or temptation; therefore
we advise her to be circumspect in all her actions. If she is
a maiden or widow, it is probable she will marry this year. If a
wife, that she will lose her children or husband. She will either
receive riches or travel into a foreign land; at all events, some circumstance
or other will take place during this remarkable year of
her life, that will have great effect on her future fortunes and existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Males.</span>&mdash;The like is applicable to men in their forty-second
year, of which there are so many instances that there is not a doubt
of its truth. Observe always to take a lease for an odd number of
years; an even number is not prosperous. The three first days of
the moon are the best for signing papers; and the first five days,
as well as the twenty-fourth, for any fresh undertaking.</p>

<h2>MOLES.<br />
<span class="smaller">THEIR SITUATION AND THE INDICATION THEY GIVE OF A PERSON’S
DISPOSITION AND FUTURE LOT IN LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>Though moles are, in their substance, nothing else than excrescences,
or ebullitions which proceed from the state of the blood
whilst the fœtus is confined in the womb, yet they are not given in
vain, as they are generally characteristic of the disposition and
temper of those that bear them; and it is also proved by daily experience
that from the shape, situation and other circumstances,
they bear a strong analogy to the events which are to happen to a
person in future life. Herein are given the common prognostications
by moles found in all the various parts of the body, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to the doctrine of the ancients. The larger the mole, the
greater the prosperity or adversity of the person; the smaller the
mole, the less will be his good or evil fate. If the mole is round,
it indicates good; if angular, it gives a mixture of good and evil;
if oblong, a moderate share of fortunate events; the deeper the
color, the more favor or disgrace; the lighter, the less of either.
If it is very hairy, much misfortune may be expected; but if few
long hairs grow upon it, it denotes that your undertakings will be
prosperous.</p>

<p>A mole that stands on the right side of the forehead, or right
temple, signifies that the person will arrive at sudden wealth and
honor, according to their birth and situation in life; which must
always be attended to with due consideration.</p>

<p>A mole on the right eyebrow announces speedy marriage; and
that the person to whom you will be married will possess many
amiable qualities and a good fortune.</p>

<p>A mole on the left of either of these three places announces
unexpected disappointment in your most sanguine wishes.</p>

<p>A mole on the outside corner of either eye denotes the person
to be of a sober, steady and sedate disposition; but will be liable to
a violent death.</p>

<p>A mole on either cheek signifies that the person shall never rise
above mediocrity in point of fortune; though at the same time he
will never fall into real poverty.</p>

<p>A mole on the nose shows that the person will have good success
in most of his or her undertakings.</p>

<p>A mole on the lip, either upper or lower, proves the person to
be fond of delicate things and much given to the pleasures of love,
in which he or she will most commonly be successful.</p>

<p>A mole on the chin foreshows the person will be attended with
prosperity and be highly esteemed.</p>

<p>A mole on the side of the neck shows that the person will narrowly
escape suffocation; but will afterward rise to great consideration
by an unexpected legacy or inheritance.</p>

<p>A mole on the throat denotes that the person shall become rich
by marriage.</p>

<p>A mole on the right breast declares the person to be exposed to
a sudden reverse from comfort to distress, by unavoidable accidents.
Most of his children will be girls.</p>

<p>A mole on the left breast signifies success in undertakings and
an amorous disposition.</p>

<p>A mole on the bosom portends mediocrity of health and fortune.</p>

<p>A mole under the left breast, over the heart, foreshadows that
the man will be of a warm disposition, unsettled in mind, fond of
rambling and light in his conduct. In a lady, it shows sincerity in
love, quick conception and easy travail in childbirth.</p>

<p>A mole on the right side, over any part of the ribs, denotes the
person to be pusillanimous, and slow in understanding anything
that may be attended with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>A mole on the belly, denotes the person to be addicted to sloth
and gluttony, selfish in almost all articles and seldom inclined to be
nice or careful in point of dress.</p>

<p>A mole on either hip shows that the person will have many
children and such of them as survive will be healthful, lusty and
patient in all hardships.</p>

<p>A mole on the right thigh shows that the person will become
rich and also fortunate in marriage.</p>

<p>A mole on the left thigh denotes that the person suffers much
by poverty and want of friends, as also by the enmity and injustice
of others.</p>

<p>A mole on the right knee signifies that the person will be fortunate
in the choice of a partner for life and meet with few disappointments
in the world.</p>

<p>A mole on the left knee portends that the person will be rash,
inconsiderate and hasty, but modest when in cold blood, honest and
inclined to good behavior.</p>

<p>A mole on either leg shows that the person is indolent, thoughtless
and indifferent as to whatever may happen.</p>

<p>A mole on either ankle denotes a man to be inclined to effeminacy
and elegance of dress&mdash;a lady, to be courageous, active and
industrious, with some spice of the termagant.</p>

<p>A mole on either foot forebodes sudden illness or unexpected
misfortune.</p>

<p>A mole on the right shoulder signifies prudence, discretion, secrecy
and wisdom.</p>

<p>A mole on the left shoulder declares a testy, contentious and ungovernable
spirit.</p>

<p>A mole on the right arm denotes vigor and undaunted courage.
On the left arm, resolution and victory in battle.</p>

<p>A mole near either elbow declares restlessness, a roving and unsteady
temper, also a discontentedness with those whom they are
obliged constantly to live with.</p>

<p>A mole between the elbow and the wrist promises the person
prosperity, but not until he has undergone and suffered many
hardships.</p>

<p>A mole on the wrist, or between it and the ends of the fingers,
denotes industry, parsimony, fidelity and conjugal affection.</p>

<p>A mole against the heart denotes wickedness. If a woman
have a mole on her right knee, she will be honest and virtuous; if
on the left, she will have many children.</p>

<p>If a woman have a mole on her lower jaw, it signifies she will
pass her life in sorrow and pain of body.</p>

<p>A mole in the midst of the forehead, near the hair, denotes a
discourteous, cruel mind and of unpleasant discourse; if it is of a
honey color, the person will be beloved; if red, sullen and furious;
if black, inexpert and wavering; if raised more like a wart, very
fortunate. But if a woman, it shows her to be a slut; and if in
her forehead black, treacherous, consents to evil and murder.</p>

<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, near the hair, predicts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
misery and abundance of tribulations to a man, by means of his
own misconduct; if honey-colored or red, his sorrows are lessened;
but if black, unfortunate in every undertaking.</p>

<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, about the midway,
threatens a man with persecutions from his superiors; if of honey
color, he prodigally wastes his estate; if red, he will become poor;
if black, let him beware of the wrath or malice of great men; if
a woman, it threatens sorrow by the perfidy of some men; if black,
she will partake of the extremity of misery.</p>

<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, a little above the temple,
if it appear red, denotes a man has excellent wit and understanding;
if black, he is in danger of being branded for his falsehoods;
if he has a wart, his fate is mitigated. To a woman it
signifies justification of innocence, though not deserved; if black,
malignity, and it represents every evil.</p>

<p>A mole appearing on the right temple, above the eye, near the
head, denotes a long life and good fortune; if pale, or red, he is
studious; to a woman, it signifies good and happy fortune in marriage,
as she will be of careful conduct.</p>

<p>A mole on the right temple, inclining towards the neck, promiseth
ingenuity and riches, as also long life; if honey or red
colored, good fortune; if black, trouble; but if as a wart, he shall
obtain all good things.</p>

<p>A mole on the left side, towards the upper part of the eye, signifies
sickness; if black, a short life; if as a wart, it denotes a
good end. To a woman, moderate health, loss of favor of friends,
perverse children and enemies; if black, many miseries.</p>

<p>A mole on the ear signifies riches and respect.</p>

<p>If either in a man or woman’s hand a mole appears, it denotes
great prosperity and enjoyment of children.</p>

<p>A mole on the left side of the stomach shows a luxurious person.</p>

<p>A mole on the left side of the belly denotes afflictions.</p>

<p>A mole under the hollow of the right eye signifies the party to
be furious.</p>

<h2>CHARTOLOGY,
OR DIVINATION BY CARDS.</h2>

<p>Take a pack of cards, shuffle and cut them three different times,
lay them on a table, nine in a row; if a man, he may choose one
of the kings to represent himself; if a woman, she must select one
of the queens; then the queen of the chosen king or the king of the
chosen queen, will stand for a husband or wife, mistress or lover,
of the party whose fortune is to be told; and the knave of the suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for the most intimate person of their family. Remember that
everything is within your circle as far as you can count nine, any
way from the card that represents the person, his wife, or her husband,
and their intimate friend; also, that the ninth card, every
way, is of the greatest consequence.</p>

<h3>CLUBS.</h3>

<p><i>Ace of Clubs</i> promises great wealth, much prosperity in life and
tranquillity of mind.</p>

<p><i>King of Clubs</i> announces a man who is humane, upright, affectionate
and faithful in all his undertakings; he will be happy himself
and make his connections so if he can.</p>

<p><i>Queen of Clubs</i> shows a tender, mild and rather amorous disposition,
one who will probably yield herself to a kind lover before
the matrimonial knot is tied; but they will be happy, love each
other and be married.</p>

<p><i>Knave of Clubs</i> shows an open, sincere friend, who will exert
himself warmly in your interest and welfare.</p>

<p><i>Ten of Clubs</i> denotes that riches will come speedily from an
unexpected quarter; it also threatens the loss of some dear friend.</p>

<p><i>Nine of Clubs</i> shows that you will displease some of your friends
by a too steady adherence to your own opinion.</p>

<p><i>Eight of Clubs</i> shows the person to be covetous and extremely
fond of money; that he will obtain it, but that it will rather prove
a torment than a comfort to him, as he will not make a proper use
of it.</p>

<p><i>Seven of Clubs</i> promises the most brilliant fortune and the most
exquisite bliss that this world can afford; but beware of the opposite
sex, as from these alone can you experience misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Six of Clubs</i> shows you will enter into a very lucrative partnership
and that your children will behave well.</p>

<p><i>Five of Clubs</i> declares that you will be shortly married to a
person who will improve your circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Four of Clubs</i> shows inconstancy for the sake of money and
change of object.</p>

<p><i>Trey of Clubs</i> shows that you will be three times married and
each time to a wealthy person.</p>

<p><i>Deuce of Clubs</i> shows that there will be some unfortunate opposition
to your favorite inclination which will disturb you.</p>

<h3>DIAMONDS.</h3>

<p><i>Ace of Diamonds</i> signifies a letter.</p>

<p><i>King of Diamonds</i> shows a man of fiery temper, continued anger,
seeking revenge and obstinate in his resolutions.</p>

<p><i>Queen of Diamonds</i> signifies that the woman will be fond of
company, be a coquette and not over virtuous.</p>

<p><i>Knave of Diamonds</i>, however nearly related, will look more
after his own interest than yours; he will be tenacious of his own
opinion and will fly off if contradicted.</p>

<p><i>Ten of Diamonds</i> promises a country husband or wife, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
great wealth and many children; the card next to it tells the number
of children; it also signifies a purse of gold.</p>

<p><i>Nine of Diamonds</i> declares that the person will be of a roving
disposition, never contented with his lot, and forever meeting with
vexations and disappointments.</p>

<p><i>Eight of Diamonds</i> shows that the person, in youth, will be an
enemy to marriage and thus run the risk of dying unmarried; but
that if he does marry, it will be late in life and then it will be with
a person whose disposition is so ill assorted to his own that it
will be the cause of misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Seven of Diamonds</i> shows you will be tormented by the infidelity
of your conjugal partner and waste of goods.</p>

<p><i>Six of Diamonds</i> shows an early marriage and premature widowhood,
but a second marriage will probably be worse.</p>

<p><i>Five of Diamonds</i> shows that you will have good children, who
will keep you from grief.</p>

<p><i>Four of Diamonds</i> shows the incontinence of the person you
will be married to, and great vexation to yourself through the
whole course of your life.</p>

<p><i>Trey of Diamonds</i> shows that you will be engaged in quarrels,
lawsuits and domestic disagreements; your partner for life will be
a vixen and of abusive temper, fail in the performance of the
nuptial duties and make you unhappy.</p>

<p><i>Deuce of Diamonds</i> shows that your heart will be engaged in
love at an early period; that your parents will not approve of your
choice, and that if you marry without their consent they will hardly
forgive you.</p>

<h3>HEARTS.</h3>

<p><i>Ace of Hearts</i> signifies feasting and pleasure; if the ace is attended
by spades it foretells quarrelling; if by hearts, it shows affection
and friendship; if by diamonds, you will hear of some absent
friend; if by clubs, merry-making.</p>

<p><i>King of Hearts</i> shows a man of good natured dissipation, but
hot and hasty, rash in his undertakings, and very amorous.</p>

<p><i>Queen of Hearts</i> denotes a woman of fair complexion, faithful
and affectionate.</p>

<p><i>Knave of Hearts</i> is a person of no particular sex, but always the
dearest friend or nearest relation of the consulting party. You
must pay great attention to the cards that stand next to the knave,
as from them alone you can judge whether the person it represents
will favor your inclinations or not.</p>

<p><i>Ten of Hearts</i> shows good nature and many children; it is a
corrective of bad tidings of the cards that stand next to it; its
neighboring cards are of good report and it ascertains and confirms
their value.</p>

<p><i>Nine of Hearts</i> promises wealth, grandeur and high esteem; if
cards that are unfavorable stand near it, you must look for disappointments,
and a reverse if favorable cards follow; these last at a
small distance, except to retrieve your losses whether of peace or
of goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Eight of Hearts</i> is a sign of drinking and feasting.</p>

<p><i>Seven of Hearts</i> shows the person to be fickle and of an unfaithful
disposition; addicted to vice, incontinent, and subject to the
mean art of recrimination to excuse themselves although without
foundation.</p>

<p><i>Six of Hearts</i> shows a generous, open and credulous disposition;
easily imposed upon, ever the dupe of flatterers, but the good
natured friend of the distressed. If this card comes before your
king or queen, you will be the dupe; if after, you will have the
better.</p>

<p><i>Five of Hearts</i> shows a wavering and unsteady disposition, never
true to one object, but free from every violent attachment.</p>

<p><i>Four of Hearts</i> shows the person will not be married until very
late in life, which will proceed from too great a delicacy in making
a choice.</p>

<p><i>Trey of Hearts</i> shows that your own imprudence will greatly
contribute to your experiencing much ill-will from others.</p>

<p><i>Deuce of Hearts</i> shows that extraordinary success and good fortune
will attend the person; though, if unfavorable cards attend,
this will be a long time delayed.</p>

<h3>SPADES.</h3>

<p><i>Ace of Spades</i> totally relates to affairs of love, without specifying
whether lawful or unlawful; it also denotes death when the
card is upside down.</p>

<p><i>King of Spades</i> shows a man ambitious and successful at court,
or with some great man, who will have it in his power to advance
him; but let him beware of a reverse.</p>

<p><i>Queen of Spades</i> shows that a person will be corrupted by the
rich of both sexes; and, if she is handsome, great attempts will be
made on her virtue.</p>

<p><i>Knave of Spades</i> shows a person who, although they have your
welfare at heart, will be too indolent to pursue it with zeal, unless
you frequently raise their attention.</p>

<p><i>Ten of Spades</i> is a card of bad import; it will in a great measure
counteract the good effects of the cards near you.</p>

<p><i>Nine of Spades</i> is the worst card in the pack; it portends dangerous
sickness, a total loss of fortune, cruel calamities and endless
dissension in your family.</p>

<p><i>Eight of Spades</i> shows you will experience strong opposition
from your friends, or those you imagine to be such. If this card
comes close to you, leave your plan and adopt another.</p>

<p><i>Seven of Spades</i> shows the loss of a most valuable friend, whose
death will plunge you in very great distress.</p>

<p><i>Six of Spades</i> announces a mediocrity of fortune, and very
great uncertainty in your undertakings.</p>

<p><i>Five of Spades</i> will give very little interpretation of your success;
it promises good luck in the choice of your companion for
life, that you will meet with one fond of you, and immoderately
attached to the joys of Hymen; it shows your temper rather sullen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Four of Spades</i> shows much sickness, and that your friends will
injure your fortune.</p>

<p><i>Trey of Spades</i> shows that you will be fortunate in marriage,
but that your partner will be inconstant, and that you will be
made very unhappy thereby.</p>

<p><i>Deuce of Spades</i> always signifies a coffin, but who it is for must
depend entirely on the other cards near it.</p>

<h2>PROGNOSTICATIONS BY DICE.</h2>

<p>This is a certain and innocent way of finding out common occurrences
about to take place. Take three dice, shake them well
in the box with your left hand, and then cast them out on a board
or table, on which you have previously drawn a circle with chalk.</p>

<p><i>Three.</i>&mdash;A pleasing surprise.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i>&mdash;A disagreeable one.</p>

<p><i>Five.</i>&mdash;A stranger who will prove a friend.</p>

<p><i>Six.</i>&mdash;Loss of property.</p>

<p><i>Seven.</i>&mdash;Undeserved scandal.</p>

<p><i>Eight.</i>&mdash;Merited reproach.</p>

<p><i>Nine.</i>&mdash;A wedding.</p>

<p><i>Ten.</i>&mdash;A christening.</p>

<p><i>Eleven.</i>&mdash;A death that concerns you.</p>

<p><i>Twelve.</i>&mdash;A letter speedily.</p>

<p><i>Thirteen.</i>&mdash;Tears and sighs.</p>

<p><i>Fourteen.</i>&mdash;Beware that you are not drawn into some trouble or
plot by a secret enemy.</p>

<p><i>Fifteen.</i>&mdash;Immediate prosperity and happiness.</p>

<p><i>Sixteen.</i>&mdash;A pleasant journey.</p>

<p><i>Seventeen.</i>&mdash;You will either be on the water or have dealings
with those belonging to it, to your advantage.</p>

<p><i>Eighteen.</i>&mdash;A great profit, rise in life, or some most desirable good
will happen almost immediately; for the answers to the dice are
always fulfilled within nine days. To show the same number
twice at one trial, portends news from abroad, be the number what
it may. If the dice roll over the circle, the number thrown goes
for nothing, but the occurrence shows sharp words; and if they
fall to the floor, it is blows. In throwing out the dice, if one remains
on top of the other, it is a present of which I would have
them take care.</p>

trouble from a quarter for which you are quite unprepared.</p>

<h2>TALISMEN, CHARMS, SPELLS AND INCANTATIONS.</h2>

<h3>TALISMAN FOR WAR AND BATTLE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/talisman-1.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Talisman for war and battle" />
</div>

<p>This Talisman, which is to
be made of highly tempered
steel, bears on it the powerful
words, and also the awful sign,
which were conveyed to the
Emperor Constantine from
heaven, in daylight, and in the
presence of his whole army,
and whereby he was victorious
in battle. It is to be tied around
the sword arm.</p>

<p>An ancient manuscript says
of it, “He that beareth this sign
about him, shall be helpen in
every need and necessity.”</p>

<h3>A TALISMAN FOR DESTROYING INSECTS AND REPTILES.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/talisman-2.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Talisman for destroying insects and reptiles" />
</div>

<p>This Talisman is to be made
of iron, when the sun and
moon enter the sign Scorpio.
It has been proved to be powerful
in effect; so much so,
that no kind of venomous reptile
or troublesome insect can
come within some yards of the
house or place in which it is.
The manuscript from which
the account of this talisman is
taken cost a very large sum,
and a medical gentleman, to
whom it belonged, affirms that
he has himself proved its efficacy;
for being at one time
much annoyed by beetles, he
made a talisman, according to instructions here given, and screwed
it to the floor, when these troublesome insects immediately disappeared;
but afterwards, when the servant removed it, through
ignorance, they returned in great numbers; when he again nailed it
to the floor, and they again disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h3>TALISMAN FOR LOVE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/talisman-3.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Talisman for love" />
</div>

<p>This Talisman is said to be
wonderfully efficacious in procuring
success in amours and
love adventures. It must be
made when Venus, the planet
of love, is the evening star.
It should be made of pure silver
and worn directly over the
heart, on the left breast.</p>

<h3>TALISMAN AGAINST ENEMIES.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/talisman-4.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Talisman against enemies" />
</div>

<p>This Talisman is to be cast of
the purest grain tin, and during
the increase of the moon.
The characters are to be engraved
on it also during the
increase of the moon. It may
be suspended about the neck,
or worn on any part of the
body, so that it be kept from the
sight of all but the wearer. Its
effects are to give victory over
enemies, protection against
their machinations, and to inspire

<p>The letters which compose this charm must be inscribed in a
pyramidical form, as above, on the purest white beeswax, of the
ordinary thickness, and of a size sufficiently large to admit of the
letters being distinctly written by the individual who is sick; or, if
he is too sick, by his dearest friend next at hand. Use for writing
them a pen made of the quill of a raven, and ink compounded
of the smoke of a concentrated taper and rain water. Let the party
who is afflicted with the disease wear the charm hung around his
neck, enclosed in a bag of virgin parchment, during the time that
the moon performs one circuit through the twelve signs of the
zodiac, and let it be commenced on the day of the full moon. The
wearer must have full faith in Divine Omnipotence, and repeat the
letters of the talisman in some one of the different directions in which
they may be read, daily.</p>

<p>If it be required to perform a cure upon one at a distance, or
without the afflicted party’s knowledge thereof, write the talisman
as above and then you may perform the cure by scraping out one
line of the talisman every day with a new knife kept for the express
purpose. At the scraping out of each line, say, “So as I destroy
the letters of this talisman, <i>Abracadabra</i>, so, by virtue of this
sacred name, may all grief and dolor depart from [here mention
the name of the sick person]. So I destroy this disease. Amen.”</p>

<p>Many have healed divers diseases in this way; the disease wearing,
little by little, away.</p>

<h3><i>Charms to be used on particular Eves of Feasts and Festivals, to
procure Dreams, Tokens, and other Insights into Futurity.</i></h3>

<h4>FEAST OF ST. ANNE’S.</h4>

<p>This is a hard trial, but what is not possible to any young lady
who wishes to know her lot in marriage?&mdash;that most important
change in human life.</p>

<p>Prepare yourself three days previous to the eve of this female
saint, by living on bread and water and sprigs of parsley, and touch
no other thing whatever, or your labor will be lost. The eve begins
at the sixth hour. Go to bed as soon as convenient, and speak
not a word after you once begin to undress; get into bed, lie on
your left side with your head as low as possible, and repeat the following
verse three times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">St. Anne, in silver clouds descend,</div>
<div class="verse">Prove thyself a female’s friend;</div>

<div class="verse">Let me have knowledge from the charm;</div>
<div class="verse">Be it husbands one, two, three,</div>
<div class="verse">Let me in rotation see;</div>
<div class="verse">And if Fate decrees me four,</div>
<div class="verse">(No good maid could wish far more),</div>
<div class="verse">Let me view them in my dream,</div>
<div class="verse">Fair and clearly to be seen;</div>
<div class="verse">But if the stars decree</div>
<div class="verse">Perpetual virginity,</div>

<h4>MAGIC ROSE.</h4>

<p>Gather your rose on the 27th of June; let it be full blown, and
as bright a red as you can get; pluck it between the hours of three
and four in the morning, taking care to have no witness of the
transaction; convey it to your chamber, and hold it over a chafing
dish or any convenient utensil for the purpose, in which there is
charcoal and sulphur of brimstone; hold your rose over the
smoke for about five minutes, and you will see it have a wonderful
effect on the flower. Before the rose gets the least cool, clap it in
a sheet of writing paper, on which is written your own name and
that of the man you love best; also the date of the morning star
that has the ascendancy at that time; fold it up and seal it neatly
with three separate seals, then run and bury the parcel at the
foot of the tree from which you gathered the flower. Here let it
remain untouched till the 6th of July; take it up at midnight,
go to bed and place it under your pillow, and you will have a singular
and eventful dream before morning, or, at least, before your
usual time of rising. You may keep the rose under your head
three nights without spoiling the charm. When you have done
with the rose and paper be sure to burn them.</p>

<h4>CUPID’S NOSEGAY.</h4>

<p>On the first night of the new moon in July, take a red rose, a
white rose, a yellow flower, a blue one, a sprig of rue and rosemary,
and nine blades of long grass; bind all together with a lock
of your own hair; kill a white pigeon, sprinkle the nosegay with
the blood from the heart, and some common salt; wrap the flowers
in a white handkerchief, and lay it under your head, on the pillow,
when you go to rest; and, before morning, you will see your fate
as clear as if you had your nativity cast by the best astrologer in
the world; not only in respect to love, lovers, or marriage, but in
the other most important affairs of your life. Storms, in this
dream, foretell great trouble; and graves or churchyards are fatal
tokens, and so is climbing steep and dangerous places.</p>

<h4>LOVE’S CORDIAL.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>To be tried the Third Night of a New Moon.</i></p>

<p>Take brandy, rum, gin, wine and the oil of amber, of each a
teaspoonful; a teaspoonful of cream, and three of spring water;
drink it as you get into bed; repeat&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This mixture of love I take for my potion,</div>
<div class="verse">That I of my destiny may have a notion;</div>
<div class="verse">Cupid befriend me, new moon be kind,</div>
<div class="verse">And show unto me the fate that’s designed.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You will dream of drink, and, according to the quality or manner
of it being presented, you may tell the condition to which you
will rise or fall by marriage. Water is poverty; and, if you dream
of a drunken man, it is ominous that you will have a drunken
mate. If you dream of drinking too much, you will fall, at a
future period, into that sad error yourself, without great care; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
what is a worse sight than an inebriated female? She cannot
guard her own honor, ruins her own and family’s substance, and
often clothes herself with rags. Trouble is often used as an excuse
for this vicious habit; but it gives more trouble than it takes away.</p>

<h4>THE NINE KEYS.</h4>

<p>Get nine small keys; they must all be your own by begging or
purchase (borrowing will not do, nor must you tell what you want
them for); plait a three-plaited band of your own hair, and tie
them together, fastening the ends with nine knots; fasten them
with one of your garters to your left wrist on going to bed, and
bind the other garter around your head; then say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">St. Peter, take it not amiss,</div>
<div class="verse">To try your favor I’ve done this;</div>
<div class="verse">You are the ruler of the keys,</div>
<div class="verse">Favor me, then, if you please:</div>
<div class="verse">Let me then your influence prove,</div>
<div class="verse">And see my dear and wedded love.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This must be done on the eve of St. Peter’s, and is an old charm
used by the maidens of Rome in ancient times, who put great faith
in it.</p>

<h4>THE WITCHES’ CHAIN.</h4>

<p>Let three young women join in making a long chain, about a
yard will do, of Christmas juniper, and mistletoe berries; and at
the end of every link put an oak acorn. Exactly before midnight
let them assemble in a room by themselves, where no one can disturb
them; leave a window open, and take the key out of the key-hole
and hang it over the chimney-piece; have a good fire, and
place in the midst of it a long thinnish log of wood, well sprinkled
with oil, salt and fresh mould; then wrap the chain around it, each
maiden having an equal share in the business; then sit down, and
on her left knee let each maiden have a prayer book, opened at
the matrimonial service. Just as the last acorn is burned, the
future husband will cross the room; each one will see her own
proper spouse, but he will be invisible to the rest of the wakeful
virgins. Those that are not to wed will see a coffin, or some misshapen
form, cross the room. Go to bed instantly, and you will all
have remarkable dreams. This must be done either on a Wednesday
or Friday night, but no other.</p>

<h4>LOVE LETTERS.</h4>

<p>On receiving a love letter that has any particular declaration in
it, lay it wide open; then fold it in nine folds, pin it next to your
heart, and thus wear it till bedtime; then place it in your left hand
glove, and lay it under your head. If you dream of gold, diamonds,
or any costly gems, your lover is true, and means what he
says; if of white linen, you will lose him by death; and if of
flowers, he will prove false. If you dream of his saluting you, he
is at present false and means not what he professes, but only to
draw you into a snare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<h4>STRANGE BED.</h4>

<p>On going to rest, take a glass of water, half fill it with salt, and
drink it off as quick as you can; do not speak afterwards, but
compose yourself to sleep, and thirst will cause you to dream;
which, joined to a strange bed, will have a true effect.</p>

<h4>THE MAGIC RING.</h4>

<p>Borrow a wedding ring, concealing the purpose for which you
borrow it; but no widow’s or pretended marriage ring will do&mdash;it
spoils the charm. Wear it for three hours at least before you retire
to rest, and then suspend it by a hair off your head, over your pillow;
write within a circle resembling a ring, the sentence from the
matrimonial service beginning with, <i>With this ring I thee wed</i>, and
around the circle write your own name at full length, and the
figures that stand for your age; place it under your pillow, and your
dream will fully explain whom you are to marry, and what kind
of a fate you will have with them. If your dream is too confused
to remember it, or you do not dream at all, it is a certain sign you
will never be married.</p>

<h4>HYMENIAL CHARM.</h4>

<p>The night before your nuptials, write your name on a piece of
paper, as small as possible, with the name of your spouse elect, the
date of the wedding day, the month and the year; enclose all in a
circle of blood drawn from one of your fingers, fold the paper into
nine folds, place it in the stocking drawn from your left leg, and
place it between your head and the pillow, and by your dreams of
that night you may guess what will be the fate attending your
nuptial life.</p>

<h4>FOR A GIRL TO ASCERTAIN IF SHE WILL SOON MARRY.</h4>

<p>Find a green pea-pod with exactly nine peas in it, and hang it
over the door of a room or entry-way, without letting any person
know that you have done so; you must then watch the door and
see who goes through first; if it is a bachelor, or an unmarried
young man, you will positively be married before the current crop
of peas is disposed of; if it is a woman, you will have to sigh in
single blessedness another year; if a married man, be careful and
not allow your lover too much liberty in his attentions.</p>

<h4>VALENTINE CHARM.</h4>

<p>If you receive one of those love tokens, and cannot guess the
party who sent it, or are in any doubt, the following method will
explain it to a certainty: Prick the fourth finger of your left hand,
and with a crow quill write on the back of the valentine the day
and hour in which you were born, and the date of the year; also
of the present one, the moon’s age, and the name of the present
morning star, all of which you will find in the almanac, and the
sign into which the sun has entered. Try this on the first Friday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
after you receive the valentine, but do not go to bed till midnight;
place the paper in your left shoe, and put it under your pillow, lie
on your left side, and repeat three times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">St. Valentine, pray condescend</div>
<div class="verse">To be this night a maiden’s friend;</div>
<div class="verse">Let me now my lover see,</div>
<div class="verse">Be he of high or low degree;</div>
<div class="verse">By a sign his station show,</div>
<div class="verse">Be it weal or be it woe.</div>
<div class="verse">Let him come to my bedside,</div>
<div class="verse">And my fortune thus decide.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The young woman will be sure to dream of the identical person
who sent the valentine and be enabled to guess if he is to be her
husband.</p>

<h4>ACORN CHARM.</h4>

<p>This is to be tried on the third day of the months between
September and March. Let any number of young women (not
exceeding nine, and minding that there is an odd one in the
company) assemble together, and each string nine acorns on a
separate string, or as many acorns as there are females in company,
but not more; wrap them around a long stick of wood, and
place it in the fire just as the clock strikes twelve at night. Say
not a word, but sit around the fire till all the acorns are consumed;
then rake out the ashes and retire to bed almost directly, repeating:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">May love and marriage be the theme,</div>
<div class="verse">To visit me in this night’s dream:</div>
<div class="verse">Gentle Venus be my friend,</div>
<div class="verse">The image of my lover send.</div>
<div class="verse">Let me see his form and face,</div>
<div class="verse">And his occupation trace;</div>
<div class="verse">By a symbol or a sign,</div>
<div class="verse">Cupid, forward my design.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h4>CHRISTMAS SPELL.</h4>

<p>Steep mistletoe berries, to the number of nine, in a mixture of
ale, wine, vinegar and honey; take them on going to bed, and
you will dream of your future lot. A storm in this dream is very
bad; it is most likely you will then marry a sailor, who will suffer
shipwreck at sea; but to see either sun, moon or stars, is an excellent
presage; so are flowers; but a coffin is an index of a disappointment
in love.</p>

<h4>LENT CHARM.</h4>

<p>To be tried on any Friday in Lent, Good Friday excepted,
when it is improper to try anything of the kind, and the mind
ought to be more seriously disposed. Write twelve letters of the
common alphabet on separate pieces of card, also twelve figures,
and the same number of blank cards; then put them in a bag and
shake them well, and let each one present draw one. A blank
shows a single life; a figure, intrigue; and a letter, a happy marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHARMS TO KNOW WHO YOUR HUSBAND SHALL BE.</h4>

<p><i>On St. Agnes’ Day.</i>&mdash;This falls on the 21st of January. You
must prepare yourself by a twenty-four hours fast, touching nothing
but pure spring water, beginning at midnight on the 20th, to
the same again on the 21st; then go to bed, and mind you sleep by
yourself, and do not mention what you are trying to any one, or it
will break the spell. Go to rest on your left side, and repeat these
lines three times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">St. Agnes, be a friend to me;</div>
<div class="verse">In the gift I ask of thee;</div>
<div class="verse">Let me this night my husband see,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and you will dream of your future spouse. If you see more men
than one in your dream, you will wed two or three times; but if
you sleep and dream not, you will never marry.</p>

<p><i>By Bride Cake.</i>&mdash;A slice of the bride cake thrice drawn through
the wedding ring, and laid under the head of an unmarried woman,
will cause her to dream of her future husband.</p>

<p><i>By the Garter and Stocking.</i>&mdash;The party inquiring must live in
a different county from that in which she commonly resides, and,
on going to bed, must knit the left garter about the right legged
stocking, letting the other garter and stocking alone; and as you
rehearse the following verse, at every comma knit a knot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This knot I knit, to know the thing I know not yet,</div>
<div class="verse">That I may see, the man that shall my husband be,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">How he goes and what he wears,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">And what he does all days and years.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, in a dream he will appear, with the insignia of his
trade or profession.</p>

<h4>TO KNOW WHETHER A WOMAN SHALL HAVE THE MAN SHE
WISHES.</h4>

<p>Get two lemon peels and wear them all day, one in each pocket,
and at night rub the four posts of the bedstead with them; if she
is to succeed, the person will appear in her sleep, and present her
with a couple of lemons; if, not, there is no hope.</p>

<h4>TO KNOW IF A WOMAN WITH CHILD WILL HAVE A GIRL OR A BOY.</h4>

<p>Write the proper names of the father and the mother, and the
month she conceived with child; add together the letters in these
words, and divide the amount by seven; if the remainder be even,
it will be a girl; if uneven, it will be a boy.</p>

<h4>TO KNOW IF A NEW-BORN CHILD SHALL LIVE OR NOT.</h4>

<p>Write the proper names of the father and the mother, and of the
day the child was born; count the letters in these words, and to
the amount add twenty-five, and then divide the whole by seven; if
the remainder be even the child shall die, but if uneven, the child
shall live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h4>TO KNOW WHAT FORTUNE YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND WILL HAVE.</h4>

<p>Take a walnut, a hazel nut and a nutmeg; grate them together,
and mix them with butter and sugar, and make them up into
small pills, of which exactly nine must be taken on going to bed,
and, according to your dreams, so will be the state of the person
you will marry. If a gentleman, your dream will be of riches; if
a clergyman, of white linen; if a lawyer, of darkness; if a tradesman,
of odd noises and tumults; if a soldier or sailor, of thunder
and lightning; if a servant, of rain.</p>

<h4>CHARM TO CURE THE HEADACHE.</h4>

<p>If the pain be on the <em>right</em> side of the head, make a comb out of
the <em>right</em> horn of a ram; and if the head be combed with it, it will
take away the pain. But if the pain be on the <em>left</em> side of the head,
then make a comb out of the <em>left</em> horn of a ram, and if the head be
combed therewith, it will stop the pain.</p>

<h4>CHARM TO MAKE A TREE BEAR FRUIT.</h4>

<p>The seeds of roses, with mustard seed, and the foot of a weasel,
tied together in something, and hung among the boughs or
branches of a tree which bears but little fruit, will remedy the defect,
and render the tree amazingly fruitful.</p>

<h4>CHARM TO HINDER FROM THE BITE OF A MAD DOG.</h4>

<p>The tooth of a mad dog which has bitten any human being,
tied in leather and hung at the shoulder, will preserve and keep
the wearer from being bitten by any mad dog so long as he wears
it. It may be worn next to the skin, or concealed in the clothing.</p>

<h4>CHARM AGAINST PERIL BY FIRE OR WATER.</h4>

<p>Repeat reverently and with sincere faith, the following words,
and you will be protected in the hour of danger:</p>

<p>“When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee.”</p>

<h4>CHARM AGAINST FURIOUS BEASTS.</h4>

<p>Repeat reverently, and with sincere faith, the following words,
and you will be protected in the hour of danger:</p>

<p>“At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, neither shalt
thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>

<p>“For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field, and
the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHARM AGAINST ENEMIES.</h4>

<p>Repeat reverently, and with sincere faith, the following words,
and you will be protected in the hour of danger:</p>

<p>“Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid,
for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become
my salvation.</p>

<p>“For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, shall
not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth,
and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</p>

<p>“And behold, at eventide, trouble; and before the morning he
is not; this is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them
that rob us.”</p>

<h4>CHARM AGAINST TROUBLE IN GENERAL.</h4>

<p>Repeat reverently, and with sincere faith, the following words,
and you shall be protected in the hour of danger:</p>

<p>“He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in seven there shall
no evil touch thee.</p>

<p>“In famine he shall redeem thee from death, and in war from
the power of the sword.</p>

<p>“And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace,
and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shall not err.”</p>

<h3>SIGNS OF SPEEDY MARRIAGE, AND GOOD SUCCESS ATTENDING IT

denotes a great union and a generous love.</p>

<p>For a man to have the first and last letters of his christian name
the same with the woman’s surname, denotes the same.</p>

<p>To think of a party on a sudden waking, without any meditation,
on a Friday morning, that before had a place in the affections
of the man or woman, is a demonstration of love or extraordinary
friendship.</p>

<p>If a ring accidentally falls off a man’s finger, that is under no
obligation of marriage, and runs directly to the feet of a maid or
widow, it denotes not only that he is in love with the party, but
that a sudden marriage will ensue.</p>

<p>The singing of a robin-red-breast at your window, in the time
of courtship, on a Wednesday, is a sign you shall have the party
desired.</p>

<p>If walking abroad with your sweetheart you perceive a pair of
pigeons circle around you, it is a sign of marriage and happiness
to ensue, with much content.</p>

<p>If a hare cross your path on a Saturday morning, it promises
happy days, riches and pleasure.</p>

<h3>THE ART OF TELLING FORTUNES BY THE GROUNDS OF A TEA
OR COFFEE CUP.</h3>

<p>Pour the grounds of coffee or tea into a white cup, shake them
well about in it, so that their particles may cover the whole surface
of the cup; then reverse it into the saucer, that all the superfluous
parts may be drained off and the figures required for fortune
telling be formed. The person that acts the fortune teller must
always bend his thoughts upon him or her that wishes to have
their fortune told, and upon their rank and profession, in order to
give plausibility to their predictions. It is not to be expected,
upon taking up the cup, that the figures will be accurately represented
as they are in cards, but it is quite sufficient if they bear
some resemblance to any of the thirty-two emblems; and the more
fertile the fancy shall be of the person that inspects the cup, the
more he will discover in it. In other respects, every one who takes
pleasure in this amusement must himself be a judge, under what
circumstances he is to make changes in point of time, speaking
just as it suits, in the present, the past, or the future; in the same
manner their ingenuity ought to direct them when to speak more
or less pointedly and detrimentally with regard to sex.</p>

<p><i>The Roads</i>, or serpentine lines, indicate ways; if they are severed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with clouds, and consequently in the thick, they are said to be
infallible marks of many past or future reverses. But if they appear
in the clear and serene, are the surest token of some fortunate
change near at hand; encompassed with many points or dots, they
signify an accidental gain of money, likewise long life.</p>

<p><i>The Ring</i> signifies marriage; if a letter is near it, it denotes to
the person that has his fortune told the initial of the name of the
party to be married. If the ring is in the clear, it portends happy
and lucrative friendship. Surrounded with clouds, denotes that
the party is to use precaution in the friendship he is about to contract,
lest he should be insidiously deceived; but it is most inauspicious
if the ring appears at the bottom of the cup, as it forebodes
an entire separation from the beloved object.</p>

<p><i>The Leaf of Clover</i> is a lucky sign. Its different position in the
cup alone makes the difference; on the top, it shows that the good
fortune is not far distant; but it is subject to delay if it is in the
middle or at the bottom. Should clouds surround it, it shows that
much disagreeableness will attend the good fortune; in the clear,
it prognosticates serene and undisturbed happiness.</p>

<p><i>The Anchor</i>, the emblem of hope and commerce, implies successful
business carried on by water or land, if on the bottom of
the cup; at the top and in the clear part, it shows constant love
and unshaken fidelity. In the thick and cloudy parts it also denotes
love, but tinctured with inconstancy.</p>

<p><i>The Serpent</i>, always the emblem of falsehood and enmity, is
likewise the general sign of an enemy. On the top, or in the
middle of the cup, it promises to the consulting party the triumph
which he desires over his enemy; but he will not obtain it so
easily if the serpent be in the thick and cloudy part. By the letter
which appears near the emblem, the enemy may be easily guessed,
as it makes the initial of his name.</p>

<p><i>The Letter.</i>&mdash;By letters we communicate to our friends either
pleasant or unpleasant news, and such is the case here; if this
emblem is in the clear part, it denotes the speedy arrival of a considerable
remittance of money, but hemmed in by clouds it is quite
the contrary, and forebodes some melancholy or bad tidings, a loss
or some other sinister accident. If it be in the clear, and accompanied
by a heart, lovers may expect a letter, which secures the
party the possession of the beloved object; but in the thick, it denotes
a refusal.</p>

<p><i>The Coffin</i>, the emblem of death, prognosticates the same thing
here, or at least a long and tedious illness; if it be in the thick, at
the top of the cup, it signifies considerable estate left to the party
by some rich relation; in the same manner at the bottom, it shows
that the deceased is not so nearly related to the consulting party.</p>

<p><i>The Star</i> denotes happiness if in the clear, and at the top of the
cup; clouded, or in the thick, it signifies long life, though exposed
to various troubles. If dots are about it, it foretells great fortune,
wealth, high respectability, &amp;c. Several stars denote so many good
and happy children, but surrounded with dashes shows that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
person’s children will cause him or her grief and vexation in old
age, and should be prevented by giving them a good education in
time.</p>

<p><i>The Dog</i>, being at all times the emblem of fidelity or envy, has
a two-fold meaning here. At the top, in the clear, it signifies true
and faithful friends, but if his image be surrounded with clouds
and dashes, it shows that those whom you take for your friends
are not to be depended on; but if the dog be at the bottom of the
cup, you have to dread the effects of extreme envy or jealousy.</p>

<p><i>The Lily.</i>&mdash;If this emblem be at the top or in the middle of the
cup, it signifies that the consulting party either has or will have a
virtuous spouse; if at the bottom, it denotes quite the reverse. In
the clear, the lily further betokens along and happy life; if clouded
or in the thick, it portends trouble and vexation, especially on the
part of one’s relations.</p>

<p><i>The Cross</i>, be it one or more, generally predicts adversities. Its
position varies, and so do the circumstances. If it be at the top,
and in the clear, it shows that the misfortunes of the party will
soon be at an end, or that he will easily get over them; but if it
appears in the middle, at the bottom, in the thick, the party must
expect many severe trials; if it appears with dots, either in the
clear or the thick, it promises a speedy change in one’s sorrow.</p>

<p><i>The Clouds.</i>&mdash;If they be more light than dark, expect good results
from wishing; but if black, you must give it up. Surrounded
with dots, they imply success in trade and all undertakings;
but, the brighter they are, the greater will be the happiness.</p>

<p><i>The Sun.</i>&mdash;An emblem of the greatest luck and happiness if in
the clear; but in the thick it bodes much sadness; surrounded by
dots or dashes, denotes that an altercation will speedily take place.</p>

<p><i>The Moon</i>, if it appears in the clear, denotes high honors; in the
dark or thick part, it implies sadness, which will, however, pass
without great prejudice. But if it be at the bottom of the cup, the
consulting party will be fortunate, both on land and water.</p>

<p><i>Mountains.</i>&mdash;If it represents only one mountain, it indicates the
favor of people of high rank; but several of them, especially in
the thick, are signs of powerful enemies; in the clear, they signify
the contrary, or friends in high life who are endeavoring to promote
the welfare of the consulting party.</p>

<p><i>Trees.</i>&mdash;One tree only, be it in the clear or thick part, points out
lasting good health; several trees denote that your wish will be
accomplished. If they are encompassed with dashes, it is a token
that your fortune is in its blossom, and will require some time to
bring it to maturity. If accompanied by dots, it is a sign that you
will make your fortune in the country where you reside.</p>

<p><i>Child.</i>&mdash;In the clear part, it bespeaks innocent intercourse between
the consultor and another person; in the thick part, excess
in love affairs, attended with great expenses; at the bottom of the
cup, it denotes the consequences of amorous excesses.</p>

<p><i>The Pedestrian</i> denotes, in general, to a merchant, good business,
pleasant news and the recovery of lost things. It also signifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that the consulting party will soon enlist, or get some new engagement.</p>

<p><i>The Rider</i> denotes good news from abroad in money matters, a
good situation in a foreign country, or good prospects. He that
doubts his fortune is promised a lasting one by this emblem.</p>

<p><i>Woman</i> signifies much joy in general. If in the clear, this emblem
has a more favorable signification than in the thick;
there it shows very great happiness; here, a great deal of jealousy.
If dots surround the image, it explains the lady’s great wealth.
The different positions in the cup show, at the top and in the
middle, that you will be in love with a virgin; but at the bottom, it
denotes she is a widow.</p>

<p><i>The Mouse.</i>&mdash;As this animal lives by stealth, it is also an emblem
here of theft and robbery; if it be in the clear, it shows you will
get again what you lost, in a wonderful manner; but if it appears
in the thick, you may renounce this hope.</p>

<h3>HOW TO READ YOUR FORTUNE BY THE WHITE OF AN EGG.</h3>

<p>Break a new-laid egg, and, carefully separating the yolk from
the white, drop the latter into a large tumbler half full of water;
place this, uncovered, in some dry place and let it remain untouched
for four-and-twenty hours, by which time the white of the
egg will have formed itself into various figures&mdash;rounds, squares,
ovals, animals, trees, crosses, &amp;c.&mdash;which are to be interpreted in
the same manner as those formed by the coffee-grounds. Of course,
the more whites there are in the glass, the more figures there will
be. This is a very pretty experiment, and much practised by the
young Scotch maidens, who, however, believe it to have more efficacy
when tried on either Midsummer Eve or Hallowe’en (31st
October).</p>

<h3>HOW TO WRITE LOVE-LETTERS SECRETLY, SO THAT THEY MAY
NOT BE DISCOVERED.</h3>

<p>Take a sheet of white paper and double it in the middle, and
cut holes through both the half sheets; let the holes be cut like a
pane of glass, or other forms that you may fancy; then with a pin
prick two little holes at each end and cut your paper in two halves;
give one half to your friend to whom you intend to write, lay your
cut paper upon a half sheet of writing paper, and stick two pins
in these holes so that it cannot stir; then, through these holes that
you cut, write your mind to your friend. When you have done,
take off your paper holes again, and then write some other idle
words, both before and after your lines, but if they were written to
make some little sense, it would carry the less suspicion; then seal
it up and send it. When your friend has received it, he must lay
his paper on the same, putting pins into the pin-holes, and then he
can read nothing but your mind that you write, for all the rest of
the lines are covered.</p>

<p><i>Another.</i>&mdash;Write what you please of a letter on one side of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sheet of letter paper with common ink; then turn your paper and
write on the other side with milk that which you would have secret,
and let it dry; but this must be written with a clean pen.
Now, when you read it, you must hold that side which is written
with ink to the fire, and the milky letters will then show bluish on
the other side.</p>

<h2>THE SILENT LANGUAGE.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW TO CONVERSE WITH ANY PERSON WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD.</span></h2>

<p>This art is performed on your hands and fingers, by the twenty-four
letters of the alphabet, which, having learned, you must spell
the words you intend your friend should know. The letters are
very easily learned and as easily remembered. You must understand
that most of the letters are upon the left hand and made with
the fingers of the right and left hand; the forefinger of your right
hand you point to every letter, but sometimes that and the two
next fingers make several letters. The vowels are very easy to remember,
they being the tops or ends of your five fingers on your
left hand, and Y is formed in the palm of your left hand, thus:</p>

<p>Practice a few times and you will soon be perfect. Several
motions represent the likeness of the letter; as, one finger on the
back of the hand is like L, two fingers like N, three like M. The
fore finger to the middle joint of the other fore finger is like T; two
fingers across is like X; likewise B, C, D, are easily remembered;
one finger on the left thumb is B, two fingers C, three fingers D.
But you must always remember to give a snap with the fingers
between the words, so that your friend may distinguish one word
from another. If you are in company, and think some others understand
you, that you would not have, it will be necessary to
change the vowels to some other part of the hand, and then none
but your friend that knows it can understand you. Suppose you
would say to a lady in a large company, “Madam, I am your
humble servant.” It is done thus:</p>

<h2>PREDICTIONS OF THE WEATHER, ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>Should the horizon in the north wear a ruddy appearance in
the evening, stormy and boisterous weather may be expected.</p>

<p>If the clouds in the south are ruddy in the evening, sunshiny
and rainy weather will prevail for some time afterward.</p>

<p>When the face of the moon is partially obscured by a light,
thin vapor, rain will shortly follow.</p>

<p>When the rays from the sun at midday are more than ordinarily
dazzling, rainy weather will shortly succeed.</p>

<p>In summertime, when the swallows fly near to the ground, rainy
weather will assuredly soon follow.</p>

<p>The shrill crowing of a cock during rainy weather, is a sign
that drought will speedily prevail.</p>

<p>When the smoke from the chimney falls down toward the
ground, instead of rising upward, it is a sign that rainy weather
will soon follow.</p>

<p>If on a foggy morning in summer the fog rises upward, it will
be a fine day; if the fog falls to the ground, it will be wet.</p>

<p>When, in summertime, you see the cattle grazing in a field
gathering together in groups, be assured that a thunderstorm is
approaching.</p>

<p>When you see the fowls in a farmyard flocking together under
some covert, be assured that ungenial weather is about to succeed.</p>

<p>When the crows, in flying over your head, make an extraordinary
and discordant cawing, rain will come on shortly.</p>

<p>When you see your dog or cat more than ordinarily restless,
frisking about the house in all directions, be assured that some
boisterous weather will shortly follow.</p>

<p>In rainy weather, when you hear the chirping of the sparrows
on the housetop more shrill than usual, it is a sign that clear and
dry weather will quickly succeed.</p>

<p>When you see a vapory fluid resting upon a stagnant pool in
the fore part of the day, you may conclude that rainy weather will
shortly come on. Should the vapor ascend and clear away, a continued
drought may be anticipated.</p>

<p>In summer, when the atmosphere is dense and heavy, and there
is scarcely a breath of air, be assured that a thunderstorm is coming
on.</p>

<p>When the firmament is lighted up with meteoric phenomena,
such as falling stars, globes of fire, &amp;c., changeable and boisterous
weather may be expected to prevail.</p>

<p>When the rising sun appears like a solid mass of fervent heated
metal, and no rays appear to emanate therefrom, fine and dry
weather may be confidently anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sun sets in a halo of ruddy brightness, genial and
bright weather may be fully relied on for the coming day.</p>

<p>When the moon appears of a ruddy hue, stormy and boisterous
weather may be expected to follow.</p>

<p>When the stars appear of a sparkling brightness, fine and genial
weather may be expected to prevail for some time. Should the
stars appear obscure and dim, changeable and rainy weather may
be anticipated.</p>

<p>The luminous appearance of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern
Lights, in the firmament, foretells the approach of stormy and
boisterous weather.</p>

<p>When the setting sun, in the autumn or winter seasons, appears
ruddy, it is a sign that high and boisterous winds may be expected
to blow from the north and northwest. When the sun at its rising,
in the autumn or winter seasons, appears ruddy, it foretells that
high and boisterous winds may be anticipated to blow from the
south and southeast.</p>

<p>When seabirds are observed flocking toward the shore, storms
and tempests may be confidently expected.</p>

<p>When in the early autumn season the migratory birds are seen
flocking together and taking their departure, it is a certain sign
that rough and boisterous weather is approaching and that a severe
winter may be anticipated.</p>

<p>When the doves around a dovecote make a more than ordinary
cooing, and frequently pass in and out of their cote, it is a sign that
a change of weather is near.</p>

<p>When the robin approaches your habitation, it is a sign that
wintry weather will shortly prevail.</p>

<p>When there is a thick vapory mist resting on the tops of high
hills in the morning and remains there during the day, it is a sign
that wet and ungenial weather may be anticipated. Should the
mist eventually rise upward and be evaporated by the sun’s rays,
a return to fine dry weather may be looked for; if, however, the
mist falls down into the valley, a continuation of wet weather will
prevail.</p>

<p>If, in taking a walk, you should see a single magpie, it is a bad
omen, especially if it should fly past you to the left hand; but, if
it should pass you to the right hand, the good will counterbalance
the bad. Should you see two magpies together, expect to hear
of something to your advantage&mdash;a proposal of marriage, if single;
or a legacy of money bequeathed to you. Should the magpies fly
past you together, to your right hand, your own marriage, or the
marriage of some one nearly related to you, will occur in a short
time. The seeing of several magpies together is considered a very
fortunate omen.</p>

<p>May is considered an unlucky month to marry in, therefore
avoid doing so if possible. If you can catch a snail by the horns
on the first of May and throw it over your shoulder, you will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
lucky throughout the year. If you place one on a slate on that
day, it will describe by its turnings the initials of your future partner’s
name.</p>

<p>If a young man or young woman, on going up a flight of stairs,
should stumble in the middle of the flight, it is a sign that his
or her marriage will take place in a short time; if the stumbling
should be near the top of the stairs, then his or her marriage will
be immediately consummated.</p>

<p>If a marriage procession, on proceeding to church or chapel,
should happen to meet a funeral procession, it is considered an unlucky
omen to the expectant bride; if, on returning after the
solemnization of the rite, a funeral procession should pass the
bridal party, it is an unfavorable sign to the bridegroom.</p>

<p>If a young person, when seated at the tea-table, should observe
one or more stalks of the tea plant in the newly poured out cup,
and if, on stirring the tea and holding the spoon in the middle of
the liquid, the stalk or stalks should come close to the spoon handle,
it is a token that he or she will be soon married.</p>

<p>When the house dog is unusually restless, and howls dismally
in the night time, it is a sign that sickness and death are about to
visit the family to whom the dog belongs.</p>

<p>When the wick of your candle shows a bright spark in the
midst of the flame, it is a sign that a long absent friend is about to
visit you.</p>

<p>When the ribs of your fire grate are more than usual covered
with flakes of soot, it is a sign that a stranger is about to visit your
habitation.</p>

<h2>DIVINATION<br />
<span class="smaller">BY THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD.</span></h2>

<p>It hath been duly observed, by the learned in all ages of the
world, that our all-wise and beneficent Creator originally implanted
in the frame of nature a means whereby mankind may attain to
the knowledge of such future contingencies as concern their welfare
and happiness; and, more especially, since we observe, even
in the brute creation, that even the most inconsiderable creatures
upon the earth are more or less endowed with a gift of foreknowledge.
Thus the industrious bee, and laborious ant, lay in
their summer store, in order to supply the necessary wants of an
inclement winter, which they foreknow is yet to come; yet, even
of all the whole race of reptiles, the ant, the spider, and the bee,
appear to be endowed with the greatest share of sagacity. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
wisdom of the ants is conspicuous in forming themselves into a
kind of republic and therein observing, as it were, their own peculiar
laws and policies; but the cunning of the spider seems to
exceed that of most other insects; its various artifices to ensnare
its prey is no less remarkable than its contrivance of a cell or retreat
behind its web, where it feasts upon its game in safety and
conceals the fragments of those carcasses it has devoured, without exposing
to public view the least remains of its barbarity, which might
tend to distinguish its place of abode, or create the least jealousy
in any sect, that their enemy was near. Into what history can we
look to find people who are governed by laws equal to what we
observe in the republic of bees? What experience can we desire
beyond what we observe in the cunning spider, to teach us to guard
against the artifices of those who lay snares to catch the thoughtless
and unwary? or what can exceed the indefatigable ant, in
teaching us lessons of frugality and industry?</p>

<p>The badger, the hedgehog and the mole also provide themselves
a magazine of plants and herbs, which they foreknow will enable
them to lie concealed in their holes during the hard frosts of winter,
contented with their prison, which affords them safety. Their
holes are constructed with amazing art, and generally have two
apertures, that in case one should be beset by an enemy, they may
escape by the other. The doublings by the hare, the tricks of the
fox to escape the hounds, are also astonishing indications of
foresight and sagacity. The feathered race are likewise endowed
with a similar faculty and often foretell an approaching storm a
considerable time before it appears, by retiring in flocks to their
holes and hiding places for shelter and protection. The birds of
passage seem to inherit this gift in a remarkable degree, for they
assemble together in prodigious flocks at an appointed hour, and
take their leave before the approach of winter; which they see
will destroy the flies and insects, as they feed on nothing else.
And it is no less extraordinary than true, that these birds return as
early as the sun brings forth this class of insects into new life,
and they have also the sagacity to find out and possess their old
nests and habitations. The wise, provident forecast for self-preservation
and safety is even extended to the innumerable
inhabitants of the immense ocean, where we see the fishes, pressed
by unceasing hunger, indiscriminately prey upon one another, the
large upon the small, even of its own species; whence the smaller
fish in regular gradations, when in danger of being devoured, fly
for an asylum to the shallow waters, where they know their enemy
either cannot or dare not come to pursue them. And this pursuit
of one species of fish after another, is by no means confined to a
single region, for we find shoals of them pursuing one another,
from the vicinity of the pole even down to the equator, and thus
the cod from the banks of the Newfoundland pursues the whiting,
which flies before it, even to the southern shores of Spain. It is
astonishing also, that herrings, which appear to generate towards
the north of Scotland, regularly make their way once a year to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the British Channel. Their voyage is conducted with the utmost
regularity, and the time of their departure is fixed from the month
of June to August. They always assemble together before they
set out and no stragglers are ever found from the general body. It
is impossible to assign any cause for this emigration, but it doubtless
proceeds from the same instinctive impulse with which all
orders of animated nature are more or less imbued.</p>

<p>Now observe, that when you go out of your house to do or
transact any kind of business, and in the way you do see a man,
or a bird going or flying, so that either of them do set themselves
before you on your right hand, that is a good signification in
reference to your business; but when you shall go out of your
house on any business whatsoever, and shall see a bird or a man
before you on the left side of you, it is an ill sign in reference to
your said business. When either a man or a bird shall thus pass
before you, coming from the right side of you and bending towards
the left, goeth out of your sight, that is a good sign concerning
your business. When you do find a man going, or a bird
flying, and then he rests himself before you on your right
side, and you seeing it, this is also a good sign of success in your
business. But when you see a man or a bird bending from your
right side to your left, it is an ill sign concerning your business;
when a man or a bird comes behind you, and goes faster than you,
but before he cometh at you he rests, or the same before you came
at him, he rests, and you seeing him on your right side, it is to
you a good sign. But when this happens on the left side, it is an
evil sign. When a man or a bird, coming from your left side,
and passing to the right, goeth out of your sight without resting,
it is a good sign. If a man or bird, coming from your right hand,
passing behind your back to the left, and you see him resting anywhere,
this is an evil sign. All the auspicia which first happeneth
in the beginning of any business, ought not to be taken notice of,
as if in the beginning of any work you find that rats have been
gnawing your clothes, then insist upon your undertakings. If, on
going out of your house, you happen to stumble on the threshold,
or if in the way you happen to dash your foot against anything,
then forbear your journey; if any ill omen ever happens at the
beginning of your business, then put it off for a while, lest you be
completely disappointed therein. If a crow, raven or a jackdaw
do croak over any person, it doth show much evil of a serious nature.
The magpie informs you that you will soon hear news and
come into company; but whether such news be good or bad, observe
whether it comes from the right hand or the left. The
screech owl is always unfortunate, for, about the 17th Oct., 1807,
Grantham church was a repository for a number of owls every
evening, for about one month, when it followed that, before that
time next year, the same church was actually robbed of all its
plate and money, to a large amount, by a gang of villains, in the
dead of the night, to the great loss and detriment of the whole
parish. If you meet sparrows, it is unfortunate, except for love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Flies indicate importunity and impudent affronts; cocks meeting
you, or crowing against your house, inform you of visitors coming
and success in your journeys and business. If you meet a hare,
a mule, or a hog, it is an ill omen; to meet horses in a carriage
is good, but if you meet an ass, expect trouble; while to meet
sheep and goats is very good and indicates prosperity in your
affairs; if you either meet a dog or oxen, you may expect the
same success, for it is good; mice indicate that you will soon
meet with danger; locusts making a stand in any place, hindereth
a person from their wishes and is an ill omen; on the contrary,
grasshoppers promote a journey and foretell a good event of
things. The spider weaving a line downwards, signifies hope of
money to come; as also the ants having a nest near your door is
good, because they know how to provide for themselves, and portend
security and riches. If you meet with a snake, take care of
an ill-tongued enemy; a viper signifies lewd women and wicked
children; an eel shows a man that is displeased with everybody.
But of all the various auspices and omens, there is none more
effectual and potent than man, none that doth signify the truth
more clearly. You must, therefore, diligently note and duly observe
the condition of that man you meet, or that meeteth you;
his age, profession, station, gesture, motion, exercise, complexion,
habit, name, words, speech, &amp;c.; for, seeing there are in all other
animals so many discoveries or presages, yet those are all more
efficacious and clear which are infused into the soul of man.</p>

<div class="verse">The o’erlabored world to toils of a new day;</div>
<div class="verse">Why, flatter’d mortals, will you wake to cares,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been truthfully observed, that half the life of even the
most miserable is as unruffled as that of the most happy of men,
for that portion is spent in sleep&mdash;in the enjoyment of quiet repose&mdash;in
peace and in security. A quiet reliance upon Providence,
a conscience void of offence, temperance and regularity, every
person can command, and these are the only requisites to secure
sound and pleasant sleep and pleasant dreams. In these every one
has happy moments&mdash;and in this life we cannot expect more than
transient gleams of sunshine&mdash;a mixture of sours and sweets,
whose agreeable or distasteful flavor depends much more upon ourselves
than is commonly imagined.</p>

<p>Addison, the virtuous and religious Addison; often dwells in
his writings upon dreams&mdash;published many of his stories as the
result of them&mdash;sometimes treated of them seriously and earnestly,
and at others brought all his powers of ridicule into play to expose
their absurdity. “Dreams,” he says, “are an instance of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
agility and perfection which is natural to the faculties of the mind,
where they are disengaged from the body. The soul is clogged
and retarded in her operations when she acts in conjunction with
a companion that is so heavy and unwieldy in her motions. But
in dreams it is wonderful to observe with what sprightliness and
alacrity she exerts herself. The flow of speech makes unpremeditated
harangues, or converses readily in languages that they are
but little acquainted with. The grave abound in pleasantries, the
dull in repartee and points of wit. There is not a more painful action
of the mind than invention; yet in dreams it works with that
ease and activity that we are not sensible of when the faculty is
employed. For instance, I believe every one, some time or other,
dreams that he is reading papers, books, or letters, in which case
the invention prompts so readily that the mind is imposed upon,
and mistakes its own suggestions for the compositions of another.”
In another part of the same paper he gives the two following problems:
“Supposing a man, always happy in his dreams and miserable
in his waking thoughts, and that his life was equally divided
between them&mdash;whether he would be more happy or miserable?
Were a man a king in his dreams and a beggar awake, and dreamed
as consequentially, and in continued unbroken schemes, as he
thinks when awake&mdash;whether he would be in reality a king or a
beggar, or rather, whether he would not be both?”</p>

<p>Addison was of opinion that some useful instruction might be
derived even from a dream: “Since we have so little time to
spare, that none of it may be lost, I see no reason why we should
neglect to examine those imaginary scenes we are presented with
in sleep, only because they have less reality in them than our waking
meditation. A traveler would bring his judgment in question, who
should despise the directions of his map for want of real roads in it,
because here stands a dot instead of a town, or a cipher instead of
a city, and it must be a long day’s journey to travel through two
or three inches. Fancy in dreams gives us much such another
landscape of life as that does of countries, and though its appearance
may seem strangely jumbled together, we may often observe
such traces and footsteps of noble thoughts, as, if carefully pursued,
might lead us into proper course of action. There is so
much rapture and ecstacy in our fancied misery, that though the
inactivity of the body has given occasion for calling sleep the image
of death, the briskness of the fancy affords us a strong intimation
of something within us that can never die.”</p>

<p>Addison, however, could treat with a happy ridicule all those
everyday dreams with which most persons are so familiar and gives
several cases from imaginary correspondents, some dissatisfied with
the non-fulfilment of their nocturnal visions, and others annoyed
at being disturbed in the midst of their delightful reveries. “I
have received,” says Addison, “numerous complaints from several
delicious dreamers, desiring me to invent some method of silencing
those noisy slaves, whose occupations lead them to take their early
rounds about the city in the morning, doing a deal of mischief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
working strange confusion in the affairs of its inhabitants. Several
monarchs have done me the honor to acquaint me, how often
they have been shook from their respective thrones by the rattling
of a coach or by the rumbling of a wheelbarrow; and many private
gentlemen, I find, have been bawled out of vast estates by fellows
not worth three-pence. A fair lady was just upon the point of
being married to a young, rich, handsome, ingenious nobleman,
when an impertinent tinker, passing by, forbade the banns; and a
hopeful youth, who had been newly advanced to great honor and
preferment, was forced by a neighboring cobbler to resign all for
an old song. It has been represented to me that those inconsiderate
rascals do nothing but go about dissolving of marriages, and
spoiling of fortunes, impoverishing rich, and ruining great people,
interrupting beauties in the midst of their conquests and generals
in the course of their victories; a boisterous peripatetic hardly goes
through a street without waking half a dozen kings and princes to
open their shops, or clean shoes, frequently transforming sceptres
into paring-shovels and proclamations into bills. I have by me a
letter from a young statesman, who in five or six hours came to be
Emperor of Europe, after which he made war upon the Great
Turk, routed him horse and foot, and was crowned lord of the
universe in Constantinople; the conclusion of all his successes is
that, on the twelfth instant, about seven in the morning, his Imperial
Majesty was deposed by a chimney sweeper. On the other
hand, I have epistolary testimonies of gratitude from many miserable
people, who owe to this clamorous tribe frequent deliverance
from great misfortunes. A small coalman, by waking one of these
distressed gentlemen, saved him from ten years’ imprisonment; an
honest watchman, bidding a loud good-morrow to another, freed
him from the notice of many potent enemies and brought all their
designs against him to nothing. A certain valetudinarian confesses
he has often been cured of a sore throat by the hoarseness of a carman
and relieved from a fit of the gout by the sound of old shoes.</p>

<p>“A citizen who is waked by one of these criers, may regard him
as a kind of remembrancer, come to admonish him that it is time
to return to the circumstances he had overlooked all the night
time; to leave off fancying what he is not, and prepare to act suitably
to the condition he is really placed in.”</p>

<p>That may be called a dream which proceeds either from the
spirit of the phantasy and intellect united together, or by the illustration
of the agent intellect above our souls, or by the true revelation
of some divine power in a quiet and purified mind; for by
this our soul receives true oracles, and abundantly yields prophecies
to us; as in dreams we seem both to ask questions and learn
to find them out. Also many doubtful things, many policies,
many things unknown, unwished for, and never attempted by our
minds, are manifested to us in dreams; also the representation of
things unknown and unknown places appear to us, and the images
of men, both alive and dead; and things to come are foretold, and
also which at any time have happened are revealed, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
know not by any report. And these kind of dreams need not any
interpretation, as those which belong to divination, not to foreknowledge;
and it comes to pass that they who have dreams for
the most part understand them not; for, as to have dreams is from
the strength of imagination, so to understand them is from the
strength of understanding. He, therefore, whose intellect being
overwhelmed by too much commerce of the flesh, is in a deep
sleep, or his fantastic power or spirit is too dull and unpolished, so
that it cannot receive the species and representation which flow
from the superior intellect; this man is altogether unfit for the receiving
of dreams and prophesying by them. Therefore it is
necessary that he who would receive true dreams, should keep a
pure, undisturbed and imaginative spirit; and so compass it that
it may be made worthy of the knowledge and government by the
mind, for such a spirit is most fit for prophesying and is a most
clear glass of all images which flow everywhere from all things.
When, therefore, we are sound in body, not disturbed in mind, our
intellect not made dull by heavy meats and strong drink, not sad
through poverty, nor provoked through lust, nor incited by any
vice, nor stirred up by wrath or anger, not being irreligiously and
profanely inclined, not given to levity, nor lost in drunkenness;
but chastely going to bed, fall asleep, then our pure and divine soul
being free from all the evils above recited, and separated from all
hurtful thoughts, and now freed, by dreaming, is endowed with
this divine spirit as an instrument, and receives those beams and
representations which are darted down as it were, and shine forth
from the divine mind into itself, in a deifying glass. It does more
certainly, more clearly and efficaciously, behold all things, than by
the vulgar inquiry of the intellect and by the discourse of reason.
The divine person instructing the soul, being invited to their society
by the opportunity of the nocturnal solitariness, neither will
that spirit of genius be wanting to him when he is awake, which
rules all our actions. But there are four kinds of true dreams,
viz.: the first, matutine, <i>i. e.</i> between sleeping and waking; the
second, that which one sees concerning another; the third, that
whose interpretation is shown to the same dreamer in the nocturnal
vision; and, lastly, that which is related to the same dreamer
in the nocturnal vision. But natural things and their own co-mixtures
likewise belong unto wise men, and we often use such to
receive oracles from a spirit by a dream, which are either by perfumes,
unctions, meats, drinks, rings, seals, &amp;c. Now those who
are desirous to receive oracles in or through a dream, let them
make themselves a ring of the sun or Saturn for this purpose.
There are likewise images of dreams, which being put under the
head when one goes to sleep, effectually give true dreams of whatever
the mind hath before determined, of which as follows:</p>

<p>Thou shalt make an image of the sun, the figure whereof must
be a man sleeping upon the bosom of an angel; which thou shalt
make when Leo ascends, the sun being in the ninth house in Aries;
then you must write upon the figure the name of the effect desired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and in the hand of the angel the name and character of the intelligence
of the sun, which is Michael.</p>

<p>Let the same image be made in Virgo ascending, Mercury being
fortunate in Aries in the ninth, or Gemini ascending, Mercury
being fortunate in the ninth house in Aquarius; and let him be
received by Saturn with a fortunate aspect, and let the name of
the spirit (which is Raphael) be written upon it. Let the same
likewise be made, Libra ascending, Venus being received from
Mercury in Gemini in the ninth house, and write upon it the name
of the angel of Venus (which is Annael). Again you make the
same image, Aquarius ascending, Saturn fortunately possessing
the ninth in his exaltation, which is Libra, and let there be written
upon it the name of the angel of Saturn, (which is Cassi-al). The
same may be made with Cancer ascending, the moon being received
by Jupiter and Venus in Pisces, and being fortunately placed in
the ninth house, and write upon it the spirit of the moon (which is
Gabriel).</p>

<p>There are likewise made rings of dreams of wonderful efficacy,
and there are rings of the sun and Saturn, and the constellation of
them is when the sun or Saturn ascend in their exaltation in the
ninth house of the nativity, and write and engrave upon the rings
the name of the sun or Saturn, and by these rules you may know
how and by what means to constitute more of yourself. But
know this, that such images work nothing (as they are simply images),
except they are vivified by a spiritual and celestial virtue
and chiefly by the ardent desire and firm intent of the soul of the
operator. But who can give a soul to an image, or make a stone,
or metal, or clay, or wood, or wax, or paper to live? Certainly no
man whatever; for this arcanum doth enter into an artist of a stiff
neck; he only hath it who transcends the progress of angels and
comes to the very Archtype himself.</p>

<p>He who is desirous of receiving true oracles by dreams, let him
abstain from supper, from drink, and be otherwise well disposed,
so his brain will be free from turbulent vapors; let him also have
his bedchamber fair and clean, exorcised and consecrated, then let
him perfume the same with some convenient fumigation, and let
him anoint his temples with some efficacious unguent and put a
ring of dreams upon his finger; then let him take one of the
images we have spoken of and place the same under his head; then
let him address himself to sleep, meditating upon that thing which
he desires to know. So shall he receive a most certain and undoubted
oracle by a dream, when the moon goes through the sign
of the ninth revolution of his nativity, and when she is in the ninth
sign from the sign of perfection.</p>

<p>This is the way whereby we may obtain all sciences and arts
whatever, whether astrology, occult philosophy, physic, &amp;c., or
else suddenly and perfectly with a true illumination of our intellect,
although all inferior familiar spirits whatsoever conduce to
this effect, and sometimes also evil spirits sensibly inform us intrinsically
and extrinsically.</p>

<h2>THE WAY TO GET RICH</h2>

<p>“There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood,
leads to fortune.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He that by the plough would thrive,</div>
<div class="verse">Himself must either hold or drive;</div>
<div class="verse">For age and want save while you may,</div>
<div class="verse">No morning’s sun lasts a whole day;</div>
<div class="verse">Get what you can, and what you get, hold,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis a stone that will turn all your lead into gold;</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore be ruled by me, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">Save something for a rainy day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Remember</i>, that time is money, for he that can earn a dollar a
day at his labor, and goes abroad, or sits at home one-half of that
day, though he spend but six cents during his diversion or idleness,
he ought not to reckon that the only expense; he has really
wasted, or rather thrown away, fifty cents besides.</p>

<p><i>Remember</i>, that credit is money; if a man lets his money lie in
my hands after it is due, because he has a good opinion of my
credit, he gives me the interest, or so much as I can make of the
money during that time; this amounts to a very considerable
sum, where a man has large credit and also makes a good use of it.</p>

<p><i>Remember</i>, that money is of a prolific or multiplying nature;
money will produce money, and its offspring will produce more;
and so five shillings turned is six, being turned again is seven and
three-pence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds; and the
more there is of it, the more it will produce on every turning, so
that the profits rise quicker and quicker; and he who throws away
a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even some scores
of pounds.</p>

<p><i>Remember</i>, that six pounds a year is a groat a day, for this little
sum (which may be daily wasted either in time or expenses unperceived),
if a proper use be made of it, he may, on his own security,
have the constant possession and use of a hundred and twenty
pounds. So much in stock, briskly turned by an industrious man,
will always produce the greatest advantage to the tradesman.
Remember this proverb, that the good paymaster is lord of another
man’s purse, for he who is known to pay punctually and exactly
at the time he promises, may, at any time, and on any occasion,
raise all the money his friend can spare. This is sometimes
of great use; next to industry and frugality nothing can
contribute more to the raising of a man in the world than punctuality
in all his dealings. Therefore, never keep borrowed money
one single hour beyond the time promised, lest the disappointment
should shut up your friend’s purse forever, as the most trifling actions
that affect a man’s credit ought always to be avoided. The
sound of the hammer at five in the morning, or at nine at night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
being heard by a creditor, makes him easy six months longer; but
if he sees you at a gaming table, or hears your voice in a tavern,
when you should be at work, he sends for his money the very next
day and demands it before it is convenient for you to pay him.
Beware of thinking all your own that you possess and of living
accordingly. This is a mistake that many people of credit fall
into; but in order to prevent this, always keep an exact account
both of your expenses and also of your daily income and profits.
For if you will only just take the trouble at first to enumerate particulars,
it will discover unto you how wonderfully trifling expenses
mount up to a large sum; by which you will also discern
what might have been, and also what may for the future be saved
without causing any great inconvenience. In short, the way to
obtain riches, if you desire it, is as plain as the way to the market,
which depends chiefly on two things, viz.: industry and frugality;
and take care that you waste neither time nor money, but daily
make use of both; if you take care of the hours and days, the
weeks, months and years will also take care of themselves. Constant
experience proves that any business being first well contrived,
is more than half done&mdash;for a sleeping fox catches no poultry;
there will be sleep enough in the grave, and also, that lost time is
seldom found again, for that which we generally call time enough,
always proves little enough; for sloth makes things difficult, while
industry makes them easy. He that rises late must trot hard all
day and shall scarce overtake his business at night&mdash;for laziness
travels so slow that poverty soon overtakes him. Drive your business,
but let not that drive you; for early to bed and early to rise,
is the way to become healthy, wealthy and wise. Industry need
not wish, while he who lives on a vain hope will die fasting; for
we find that there is nothing to be done or accomplished under the
sun without labor. He that hath a trade, hath an estate, and he
that hath a profession, hath an office and profit with honor;
but then the trade must be worked at, and the profession well followed,
or they will not enable you to pay rent and taxes. At the
working man’s house hunger looks in but dares not enter; for industry
pays debts, while despair increases them. Diligence is the
mother of good luck; as Solomon saith: “The diligent hand maketh
rich, while he that dealeth with a slack hand becometh poor;
for God gives all things to industry.” Then plow deep while the
sluggards sleep, and you shall have plenty, while others have reason
to complain of hard times. Therefore keep working while it
is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered
to-morrow; and never leave that business to be done to-morrow
which you can do to-day; for since you are not sure of a single
hour, throw not that away. How many are they who live daily
by their wits, and who often break from want of a stock in hand,
while industry gives comfort, plenty and respect. Keep your shop
well and then your shop will keep you. For it sometimes happens
that the eyes of a master will do more work than both his hands,
and more especially if his head be any reasonable length; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
want of care doth more damage than the want of knowledge. If
you do not overlook your workmen, you may just as well leave
them your purse open; the trusting too much to the care of others
has completely ruined many a man. If you would be wealthy,
think of being careful and saving; for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Women and wine, game and deceit,</div>
<div class="verse">Make the wealth small and the wants great.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That which maintains one vice, would bring up two children.
And if you wish to know the value of money, only just go and
try to borrow a little; he that goes borrowing, goes sorrowing, and,
indeed, so doth he who lends it unto such people, when he goes to
try to get it back again. Pride that dines on vanity, sups on content
and often breakfasts with plenty, dines with poverty and sups
with infamy, creates envy, and hastens misfortunes; for it is hard
for an empty bag to stand upright. Creditors have generally
much better memories than debtors, who are also a kind of superstitious
set, great observers of set or appointed days and times; so
that those have but a short Lent who owe money to be paid at
Easter; for expenses are always so constant and certain, that it is
much easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel.
Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt. Always do unto
others as you would wish to be done by, is the first fundamental
law of natural justice.</p>

<h2>JUST THE BOOK YOU NEED.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="larger">The Complete Letter Writer</span><br />
FOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.</p>

<p>This is the first time that a book has been published that plainly teaches
<b>how to write a letter</b>. It shows clearly all the blunders and mistakes apt
to be made by an inexperienced writer, and makes manifest in the simplest
way the proper method of avoiding and rectifying such blunders and mistakes,
whether they occur in the spelling, the punctuation or the grammar.</p>

<p>This book explains all the details of correspondence, whether relating to
the form, the penmanship, the directing, folding and sending of a note or
a letter. There are in this book valuable hints about <b>Love, Courtship and
Marriage</b>, showing in what style lovers should indite epistles.</p>

<p>There are given all the various letters that arise in the course of business:
Asking for money, requesting time, enclosing remittance, asking assistance,
reasons for refusal, from tenants to landlords on different subjects, with landlords’
replies. Then&mdash;<b>and this is a very important feature</b>&mdash;there is
shown the legal importance of a letter; and explanations are given upon the
exact meaning of expressions used in writing, that may be brought into court
in litigations. It also contains the <b>art of abbreviating writing</b>, so that
any one can, with practice, write with the rapidity of the shorthand writer.
In fact, <b>the following persons all require this book</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>YOUNG LADIES AND YOUNG GENTLEMEN.</li>
<li>WIVES AND HUSBANDS.</li>
<li>WIDOWS AND BACHELORS.</li>
<li>FARMERS AND TRADERS.</li>
<li>THE SICK AND THE WELL.</li>
<li>SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.</li>
<li>MOTHERS AND FATHERS.</li>
<li>DAUGHTERS AND SONS.</li>
<li>GIVERS AND RECEIVERS OF PRESENTS.</li>
<li>THE EDUCATED AND THE ILLITERATE.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it would take page after page to begin to enumerate all the different
classes to whom “<b>The Complete Letter Writer</b>” would prove an invaluable
companion. There is nothing worth knowing in any other letter
writer not to be found here, while there are many things of importance here
not to be found in any other book. Notwithstanding all these good points
it is only <b>Twenty-five Cents a copy</b>, and is sent at that price, postage
paid, to any part of the United States or Canada. Address</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
